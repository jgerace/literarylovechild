WEATHERS


                                    I

   THIS is the weather the cuckoo likes,
      And so do I;
   When showers betumble the chestnut spikes,
      And nestlings fly:
   And the little brown nightingale bills his best,
   And they sit outside at “The Travellers’ Rest,”
   And maids come forth sprig-muslin drest,
   And citizens dream of the south and west,
      And so do I.

                                    II

   This is the weather the shepherd shuns,
      And so do I;
   When beeches drip in browns and duns,
      And thresh, and ply;
   And hill-hid tides throb, throe on throe,
   And meadow rivulets overflow,
   And drops on gate-bars hang in a row,
   And rooks in families homeward go,
      And so do I.




THE MAID OF KEINTON MANDEVILLE
(A TRIBUTE TO SIR H. BISHOP)


   I HEAR that maiden still
   Of Keinton Mandeville
   Singing, in flights that played
   As wind-wafts through us all,
   Till they made our mood a thrall
   To their aery rise and fall,
      “Should he upbraid.”

   Rose-necked, in sky-gray gown,
   From a stage in Stower Town
   Did she sing, and singing smile
   As she blent that dexterous voice
   With the ditty of her choice,
   And banished our annoys
      Thereawhile.

   One with such song had power
   To wing the heaviest hour
   Of him who housed with her.
   Who did I never knew
   When her spoused estate ondrew,
   And her warble flung its woo
      In his ear.

   Ah, she’s a beldame now,
   Time-trenched on cheek and brow,
   Whom I once heard as a maid
   From Keinton Mandeville
   Of matchless scope and skill
   Sing, with smile and swell and trill,
      “Should he upbraid!”

1915 or 1916.




SUMMER SCHEMES


   WHEN friendly summer calls again,
         Calls again
   Her little fifers to these hills,
   We’ll go—we two—to that arched fane
   Of leafage where they prime their bills
   Before they start to flood the plain
   With quavers, minims, shakes, and trills.
      “—We’ll go,” I sing; but who shall say
      What may not chance before that day!

   And we shall see the waters spring,
         Waters spring
   From chinks the scrubby copses crown;
   And we shall trace their oncreeping
   To where the cascade tumbles down
   And sends the bobbing growths aswing,
   And ferns not quite but almost drown.
      “—We shall,” I say; but who may sing
      Of what another moon will bring!




EPEISODIA


                                    I

   PAST the hills that peep
   Where the leaze is smiling,
   On and on beguiling
   Crisply-cropping sheep;
   Under boughs of brushwood
   Linking tree and tree
   In a shade of lushwood,
      There caressed we!

                                    II

   Hemmed by city walls
   That outshut the sunlight,
   In a foggy dun light,
   Where the footstep falls
   With a pit-pat wearisome
   In its cadency
   On the flagstones drearisome
      There pressed we!

                                   III

   Where in wild-winged crowds
   Blown birds show their whiteness
   Up against the lightness
   Of the clammy clouds;
   By the random river
   Pushing to the sea,
   Under bents that quiver
      There rest we.




FAINTHEART IN A RAILWAY TRAIN


   AT nine in the morning there passed a church,
   At ten there passed me by the sea,
   At twelve a town of smoke and smirch,
   At two a forest of oak and birch,
      And then, on a platform, she:

   A radiant stranger, who saw not me.
   I queried, “Get out to her do I dare?”
   But I kept my seat in my search for a plea,
   And the wheels moved on. O could it but be
      That I had alighted there!




AT MOONRISE AND ONWARDS


         I THOUGHT you a fire
      On Heron-Plantation Hill,
   Dealing out mischief the most dire
      To the chattels of men of hire
         There in their vill.

         But by and by
      You turned a yellow-green,
   Like a large glow-worm in the sky;
      And then I could descry
         Your mood and mien.

         How well I know
      Your furtive feminine shape!
   As if reluctantly you show
      You nude of cloud, and but by favour throw
         Aside its drape . . .

         —How many a year
      Have you kept pace with me,
   Wan Woman of the waste up there,
      Behind a hedge, or the bare
         Bough of a tree!

         No novelty are you,
      O Lady of all my time,
   Veering unbid into my view
      Whether I near Death’s mew,
         Or Life’s top cyme!




THE GARDEN SEAT


   ITS former green is blue and thin,
   And its once firm legs sink in and in;
   Soon it will break down unaware,
   Soon it will break down unaware.

   At night when reddest flowers are black
   Those who once sat thereon come back;
   Quite a row of them sitting there,
   Quite a row of them sitting there.

   With them the seat does not break down,
   Nor winter freeze them, nor floods drown,
   For they are as light as upper air,
   They are as light as upper air!




BARTHÉLÉMON AT VAUXHALL


François Hippolite Barthélémon, first-fiddler at Vauxhall Gardens,
composed what was probably the most popular morning hymn-tune ever
written.  It was formerly sung, full-voiced, every Sunday in most
churches, to Bishop Ken’s words, but is now seldom heard.

   HE said: “Awake my soul, and with the sun,” . . .
   And paused upon the bridge, his eyes due east,
   Where was emerging like a full-robed priest
   The irradiate globe that vouched the dark as done.

   It lit his face—the weary face of one
   Who in the adjacent gardens charged his string,
   Nightly, with many a tuneful tender thing,
   Till stars were weak, and dancing hours outrun.

   And then were threads of matin music spun
   In trial tones as he pursued his way:
   “This is a morn,” he murmured, “well begun:
   This strain to Ken will count when I am clay!”

   And count it did; till, caught by echoing lyres,
   It spread to galleried naves and mighty quires.




“I SOMETIMES THINK”
(FOR F. E. H.)


   I SOMETIMES think as here I sit
      Of things I have done,
   Which seemed in doing not unfit
      To face the sun:
   Yet never a soul has paused a whit
      On such—not one.

   There was that eager strenuous press
      To sow good seed;
   There was that saving from distress
      In the nick of need;
   There were those words in the wilderness:
      Who cared to heed?

   Yet can this be full true, or no?
      For one did care,
   And, spiriting into my house, to, fro,
      Like wind on the stair,
   Cares still, heeds all, and will, even though
      I may despair.




JEZREEL
ON ITS SEIZURE BY THE ENGLISH UNDER ALLENBY, SEPTEMBER 1918


   DID they catch as it were in a Vision at shut of the day—
   When their cavalry smote through the ancient Esdraelon Plain,
   And they crossed where the Tishbite stood forth in his enemy’s way—
   His gaunt mournful Shade as he bade the King haste off amain?

   On war-men at this end of time—even on Englishmen’s eyes—
   Who slay with their arms of new might in that long-ago place,
   Flashed he who drove furiously? . . . Ah, did the phantom arise
   Of that queen, of that proud Tyrian woman who painted her face?

   Faintly marked they the words “Throw her down!” rise from Night
   eerily,
   Spectre-spots of the blood of her body on some rotten wall?
   And the thin note of pity that came: “A King’s daughter is she,”
   As they passed where she trodden was once by the chargers’ footfall?

   Could such be the hauntings of men of to-day, at the cease
   Of pursuit, at the dusk-hour, ere slumber their senses could seal?
   Enghosted seers, kings—one on horseback who asked “Is it peace?” . . .
   Yea, strange things and spectral may men have beheld in Jezreel!

_September_ 24, 1918.




A JOG-TROT PAIR


      WHO were the twain that trod this track
         So many times together
            Hither and back,
   In spells of certain and uncertain weather?

      Commonplace in conduct they
         Who wandered to and fro here
            Day by day:
   Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here.

      The very gravel-path was prim
         That daily they would follow:
            Borders trim:
   Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow.

      Trite usages in tamest style
         Had tended to their plighting.
            “It’s just worth while,
   Perhaps,” they had said.  “And saves much sad good-nighting.”

      And petty seemed the happenings
         That ministered to their joyance:
            Simple things,
   Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance.

      Who could those common people be,
         Of days the plainest, barest?
            They were we;
   Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest.




“THE CURTAINS NOW ARE DRAWN”
(SONG)


                                    I

      THE curtains now are drawn,
      And the spindrift strikes the glass,
      Blown up the jagged pass
      By the surly salt sou’-west,
      And the sneering glare is gone
      Behind the yonder crest,
         While she sings to me:
   “O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine,
   And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine,
   And death may come, but loving is divine.”

                                     II

      I stand here in the rain,
      With its smite upon her stone,
      And the grasses that have grown
      Over women, children, men,
      And their texts that “Life is vain”;
      But I hear the notes as when
         Once she sang to me:
   “O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine,
   And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine,
   And death may come, but loving is divine.”

1913.



“ACCORDING TO THE MIGHTY WORKING”


                                    I

   WHEN moiling seems at cease
      In the vague void of night-time,
      And heaven’s wide roomage stormless
      Between the dusk and light-time,
      And fear at last is formless,
   We call the allurement Peace.

                                    II

   Peace, this hid riot, Change,
      This revel of quick-cued mumming,
      This never truly being,
      This evermore becoming,
      This spinner’s wheel onfleeing
   Outside perception’s range.

1917.




“I WAS NOT HE”
(SONG)


      I WAS not he—the man
   Who used to pilgrim to your gate,
   At whose smart step you grew elate,
      And rosed, as maidens can,
         For a brief span.

      It was not I who sang
   Beside the keys you touched so true
   With note-bent eyes, as if with you
      It counted not whence sprang
         The voice that rang . . .

      Yet though my destiny
   It was to miss your early sweet,
   You still, when turned to you my feet,
      Had sweet enough to be
         A prize for me!




THE WEST-OF-WESSEX GIRL


   A VERY West-of-Wessex girl,
      As blithe as blithe could be,
      Was once well-known to me,
   And she would laud her native town,
      And hope and hope that we
   Might sometime study up and down
      Its charms in company.

   But never I squired my Wessex girl
      In jaunts to Hoe or street
      When hearts were high in beat,
   Nor saw her in the marbled ways
      Where market-people meet
   That in her bounding early days
      Were friendly with her feet.

   Yet now my West-of-Wessex girl,
      When midnight hammers slow
      From Andrew’s, blow by blow,
   As phantom draws me by the hand
      To the place—Plymouth Hoe—
   Where side by side in life, as planned,
      We never were to go!

Begun in Plymouth, _March_ 1913.




WELCOME HOME


      TO my native place
      Bent upon returning,
      Bosom all day burning
      To be where my race
   Well were known, ’twas much with me
   There to dwell in amity.

      Folk had sought their beds,
      But I hailed: to view me
      Under the moon, out to me
      Several pushed their heads,
   And to each I told my name,
   Plans, and that therefrom I came.

      “Did you? . . .  Ah, ’tis true
      I once heard, back a long time,
      Here had spent his young time,
      Some such man as you . . .
   Good-night.”  The casement closed again,
   And I was left in the frosty lane.




GOING AND STAYING


                                    I

   THE moving sun-shapes on the spray,
   The sparkles where the brook was flowing,
   Pink faces, plightings, moonlit May,
   These were the things we wished would stay;
      But they were going.

                                    II

   Seasons of blankness as of snow,
   The silent bleed of a world decaying,
   The moan of multitudes in woe,
   These were the things we wished would go;
      But they were staying.

                                   III

   Then we looked closelier at Time,
   And saw his ghostly arms revolving
   To sweep off woeful things with prime,
   Things sinister with things sublime
      Alike dissolving.




READ BY MOONLIGHT


   I PAUSED to read a letter of hers
      By the moon’s cold shine,
   Eyeing it in the tenderest way,
   And edging it up to catch each ray
      Upon her light-penned line.
   I did not know what years would flow
      Of her life’s span and mine
   Ere I read another letter of hers
      By the moon’s cold shine!

   I chance now on the last of hers,
      By the moon’s cold shine;
   It is the one remaining page
   Out of the many shallow and sage
      Whereto she set her sign.
   Who could foresee there were to be
      Such letters of pain and pine
   Ere I should read this last of hers
      By the moon’s cold shine!




AT A HOUSE IN HAMPSTEAD
SOMETIME THE DWELLING OF JOHN KEATS


   O POET, come you haunting here
   Where streets have stolen up all around,
   And never a nightingale pours one
      Full-throated sound?

   Drawn from your drowse by the Seven famed Hills,
   Thought you to find all just the same
   Here shining, as in hours of old,
      If you but came?

   What will you do in your surprise
   At seeing that changes wrought in Rome
   Are wrought yet more on the misty slope
      One time your home?

   Will you wake wind-wafts on these stairs?
   Swing the doors open noisily?
   Show as an umbraged ghost beside
      Your ancient tree?

   Or will you, softening, the while
   You further and yet further look,
   Learn that a laggard few would fain
      Preserve your nook? . . .

   —Where the Piazza steps incline,
   And catch late light at eventide,
   I once stood, in that Rome, and thought,
      “’Twas here he died.”

   I drew to a violet-sprinkled spot,
   Where day and night a pyramid keeps
   Uplifted its white hand, and said,
      “’Tis there he sleeps.”

   Pleasanter now it is to hold
   That here, where sang he, more of him
   Remains than where he, tuneless, cold,
      Passed to the dim.

_July_ 1920.




A WOMAN’S FANCY


   “AH Madam; you’ve indeed come back here?
      ’Twas sad—your husband’s so swift death,
   And you away!  You shouldn’t have left him:
         It hastened his last breath.”

   “Dame, I am not the lady you think me;
      I know not her, nor know her name;
   I’ve come to lodge here—a friendless woman;
         My health my only aim.”

   She came; she lodged.  Wherever she rambled
      They held her as no other than
   The lady named; and told how her husband
         Had died a forsaken man.

   So often did they call her thuswise
      Mistakenly, by that man’s name,
   So much did they declare about him,
         That his past form and fame

   Grew on her, till she pitied his sorrow
      As if she truly had been the cause—
   Yea, his deserter; and came to wonder
         What mould of man he was.

   “Tell me my history!” would exclaim she;
      “_Our_ history,” she said mournfully.
   “But _you_ know, surely, Ma’am?” they would answer,
         Much in perplexity.

   Curious, she crept to his grave one evening,
      And a second time in the dusk of the morrow;
   Then a third time, with crescent emotion
         Like a bereaved wife’s sorrow.

   No gravestone rose by the rounded hillock;
      —“I marvel why this is?” she said.
   —“He had no kindred, Ma’am, but you near.”
         —She set a stone at his head.

   She learnt to dream of him, and told them:
      “In slumber often uprises he,
   And says: ‘I am joyed that, after all, Dear,
         You’ve not deserted me!”

   At length died too this kinless woman,
      As he had died she had grown to crave;
   And at her dying she besought them
         To bury her in his grave.

   Such said, she had paused; until she added:
      “Call me by his name on the stone,
   As I were, first to last, his dearest,
         Not she who left him lone!”

   And this they did.  And so it became there
      That, by the strength of a tender whim,
   The stranger was she who bore his name there,
         Not she who wedded him.




HER SONG


   I SANG that song on Sunday,
      To witch an idle while,
   I sang that song on Monday,
      As fittest to beguile;
   I sang it as the year outwore,
         And the new slid in;
   I thought not what might shape before
      Another would begin.

   I sang that song in summer,
      All unforeknowingly,
   To him as a new-comer
      From regions strange to me:
   I sang it when in afteryears
         The shades stretched out,
   And paths were faint; and flocking fears
      Brought cup-eyed care and doubt.

   Sings he that song on Sundays
      In some dim land afar,
   On Saturdays, or Mondays,
      As when the evening star
   Glimpsed in upon his bending face
         And my hanging hair,
   And time untouched me with a trace
      Of soul-smart or despair?




A WET AUGUST


   NINE drops of water bead the jessamine,
   And nine-and-ninety smear the stones and tiles:
   —’Twas not so in that August—full-rayed, fine—
   When we lived out-of-doors, sang songs, strode miles.

   Or was there then no noted radiancy
   Of summer?  Were dun clouds, a dribbling bough,
   Gilt over by the light I bore in me,
   And was the waste world just the same as now?

   It can have been so: yea, that threatenings
   Of coming down-drip on the sunless gray,
   By the then possibilities in things
   Were wrought more bright than brightest skies to-day.

1920.




THE DISSEMBLERS


   “IT was not you I came to please,
      Only myself,” flipped she;
   “I like this spot of phantasies,
      And thought you far from me.”
   But O, he was the secret spell
      That led her to the lea!

   “It was not she who shaped my ways,
      Or works, or thoughts,” he said.
   “I scarcely marked her living days,
      Or missed her much when dead.”
   But O, his joyance knew its knell
      When daisies hid her head!




TO A LADY PLAYING AND SINGING IN THE MORNING


      JOYFUL lady, sing!
   And I will lurk here listening,
   Though nought be done, and nought begun,
   And work-hours swift are scurrying.

      Sing, O lady, still!
   Aye, I will wait each note you trill,
   Though duties due that press to do
   This whole day long I unfulfil.

      “—It is an evening tune;
   One not designed to waste the noon,”
   You say.  I know: time bids me go—
   For daytide passes too, too soon!

      But let indulgence be,
   This once, to my rash ecstasy:
   When sounds nowhere that carolled air
   My idled morn may comfort me!




“A MAN WAS DRAWING NEAR TO ME”


   ON that gray night of mournful drone,
   A part from aught to hear, to see,
   I dreamt not that from shires unknown
      In gloom, alone,
      By Halworthy,
   A man was drawing near to me.

   I’d no concern at anything,
   No sense of coming pull-heart play;
   Yet, under the silent outspreading
      Of even’s wing
      Where Otterham lay,
   A man was riding up my way.

   I thought of nobody—not of one,
   But only of trifles—legends, ghosts—
   Though, on the moorland dim and dun
      That travellers shun
      About these coasts,
   The man had passed Tresparret Posts.

   There was no light at all inland,
   Only the seaward pharos-fire,
   Nothing to let me understand
      That hard at hand
      By Hennett Byre
   The man was getting nigh and nigher.

   There was a rumble at the door,
   A draught disturbed the drapery,
   And but a minute passed before,
      With gaze that bore
      My destiny,
   The man revealed himself to me.




THE STRANGE HOUSE
(MAX GATE, A.D. 2000)


   “I HEAR the piano playing—
      Just as a ghost might play.”
   “—O, but what are you saying?
      There’s no piano to-day;
   Their old one was sold and broken;
      Years past it went amiss.”
   “—I heard it, or shouldn’t have spoken:
         A strange house, this!

   “I catch some undertone here,
      From some one out of sight.”
   “—Impossible; we are alone here,
      And shall be through the night.”
   “—The parlour-door—what stirred it?”
      “—No one: no soul’s in range.”
   “—But, anyhow, I heard it,
         And it seems strange!

   “Seek my own room I cannot—
      A figure is on the stair!”
   “—What figure?  Nay, I scan not
      Any one lingering there.
   A bough outside is waving,
      And that’s its shade by the moon.”
   “—Well, all is strange!  I am craving
         Strength to leave soon.”

   “—Ah, maybe you’ve some vision
      Of showings beyond our sphere;
   Some sight, sense, intuition
      Of what once happened here?
   The house is old; they’ve hinted
      It once held two love-thralls,
   And they may have imprinted
         Their dreams on its walls?

   “They were—I think ’twas told me—
      Queer in their works and ways;
   The teller would often hold me
      With weird tales of those days.
   Some folk can not abide here,
      But we—we do not care
   Who loved, laughed, wept, or died here,
         Knew joy, or despair.”




“AS ’TWERE TO-NIGHT”
(SONG)


   AS ’twere to-night, in the brief space
      Of a far eventime,
      My spirit rang achime
   At vision of a girl of grace;
   As ’twere to-night, in the brief space
      Of a far eventime.

   As ’twere at noontide of to-morrow
      I airily walked and talked,
      And wondered as I walked
   What it could mean, this soar from sorrow;
   As ’twere at noontide of to-morrow
      I airily walked and talked.

   As ’twere at waning of this week
      Broke a new life on me;
      Trancings of bliss to be
   In some dim dear land soon to seek;
   As ’twere at waning of this week
      Broke a new life on me!




THE CONTRETEMPS


      A FORWARD rush by the lamp in the gloom,
         And we clasped, and almost kissed;
      But she was not the woman whom
      I had promised to meet in the thawing brume
   On that harbour-bridge; nor was I he of her tryst.

      So loosening from me swift she said:
         “O why, why feign to be
      The one I had meant!—to whom I have sped
      To fly with, being so sorrily wed!”
   —’Twas thus and thus that she upbraided me.

      My assignation had struck upon
         Some others’ like it, I found.
      And her lover rose on the night anon;
      And then her husband entered on
   The lamplit, snowflaked, sloppiness around.

      “Take her and welcome, man!” he cried:
         “I wash my hands of her.
      I’ll find me twice as good a bride!”
      —All this to me, whom he had eyed,
   Plainly, as his wife’s planned deliverer.

      And next the lover: “Little I knew,
         Madam, you had a third!
      Kissing here in my very view!”
      —Husband and lover then withdrew.
   I let them; and I told them not they erred.

      Why not?  Well, there faced she and I—
         Two strangers who’d kissed, or near,
      Chancewise.  To see stand weeping by
      A woman once embraced, will try
   The tension of a man the most austere.

      So it began; and I was young,
         She pretty, by the lamp,
      As flakes came waltzing down among
      The waves of her clinging hair, that hung
   Heavily on her temples, dark and damp.

      And there alone still stood we two;
         She one cast off for me,
      Or so it seemed: while night ondrew,
      Forcing a parley what should do
   We twain hearts caught in one catastrophe.

      In stranded souls a common strait
         Wakes latencies unknown,
      Whose impulse may precipitate
      A life-long leap.  The hour was late,
   And there was the Jersey boat with its funnel agroan.

      “Is wary walking worth much pother?”
         It grunted, as still it stayed.
      “One pairing is as good as another
      Where all is venture!  Take each other,
   And scrap the oaths that you have aforetime made.” . . .

      —Of the four involved there walks but one
         On earth at this late day.
      And what of the chapter so begun?
      In that odd complex what was done?
      Well; happiness comes in full to none:
   Let peace lie on lulled lips: I will not say.

WEYMOUTH.




A GENTLEMAN’S EPITAPH ON HIMSELF AND A LADY, WHO WERE BURIED TOGETHER


   I DWELT in the shade of a city,
      She far by the sea,
   With folk perhaps good, gracious, witty;
      But never with me.

   Her form on the ballroom’s smooth flooring
      I never once met,
   To guide her with accents adoring
      Through Weippert’s “First Set.” {46}

   I spent my life’s seasons with pale ones
      In Vanity Fair,
   And she enjoyed hers among hale ones
      In salt-smelling air.

   Maybe she had eyes of deep colour,
      Maybe they were blue,
   Maybe as she aged they got duller;
      That never I knew.

   She may have had lips like the coral,
      But I never kissed them,
   Saw pouting, nor curling in quarrel,
      Nor sought for, nor missed them.

   Not a word passed of love all our lifetime,
      Between us, nor thrill;
   We’d never a husband-and-wife time,
      For good or for ill.

   Yet as one dust, through bleak days and vernal,
      Lie I and lies she,
   This never-known lady, eternal
      Companion to me!




THE OLD GOWN
(SONG)


   I HAVE seen her in gowns the brightest,
      Of azure, green, and red,
   And in the simplest, whitest,
      Muslined from heel to head;
   I have watched her walking, riding,
      Shade-flecked by a leafy tree,
   Or in fixed thought abiding
      By the foam-fingered sea.

   In woodlands I have known her,
      When boughs were mourning loud,
   In the rain-reek she has shown her
      Wild-haired and watery-browed.
   And once or twice she has cast me
      As she pomped along the street
   Court-clad, ere quite she had passed me,
      A glance from her chariot-seat.

   But in my memoried passion
      For evermore stands she
   In the gown of fading fashion
      She wore that night when we,
   Doomed long to part, assembled
      In the snug small room; yea, when
   She sang with lips that trembled,
      “Shall I see his face again?”




A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER


   I MARKED when the weather changed,
   And the panes began to quake,
   And the winds rose up and ranged,
   That night, lying half-awake.

   Dead leaves blew into my room,
   And alighted upon my bed,
   And a tree declared to the gloom
   Its sorrow that they were shed.

   One leaf of them touched my hand,
   And I thought that it was you
   There stood as you used to stand,
   And saying at last you knew!

A DUETTIST TO HER PIANOFORTE
SONG OF SILENCE
(E. L. H.—H. C. H.)


   SINCE every sound moves memories,
      How can I play you
   Just as I might if you raised no scene,
   By your ivory rows, of a form between
   My vision and your time-worn sheen,
         As when each day you
   Answered our fingers with ecstasy?
   So it’s hushed, hushed, hushed, you are for me!

   And as I am doomed to counterchord
      Her notes no more
   In those old things I used to know,
   In a fashion, when we practised so,
   “Good-night!—Good-bye!” to your pleated show
         Of silk, now hoar,
   Each nodding hammer, and pedal and key,
   For dead, dead, dead, you are to me!

   I fain would second her, strike to her stroke,
      As when she was by,
   Aye, even from the ancient clamorous “Fall
   Of Paris,” or “Battle of Prague” withal,
   To the “Roving Minstrels,” or “Elfin Call”
         Sung soft as a sigh:
   But upping ghosts press achefully,
   And mute, mute, mute, you are for me!

   Should I fling your polyphones, plaints, and quavers
      Afresh on the air,
   Too quick would the small white shapes be here
   Of the fellow twain of hands so dear;
   And a black-tressed profile, and pale smooth ear;
         —Then how shall I bear
   Such heavily-haunted harmony?
   Nay: hushed, hushed, hushed you are for me!




“WHERE THREE ROADS JOINED”


   WHERE three roads joined it was green and fair,
   And over a gate was the sun-glazed sea,
   And life laughed sweet when I halted there;
   Yet there I never again would be.

   I am sure those branchways are brooding now,
   With a wistful blankness upon their face,
   While the few mute passengers notice how
   Spectre-beridden is the place;

   Which nightly sighs like a laden soul,
   And grieves that a pair, in bliss for a spell
   Not far from thence, should have let it roll
   Away from them down a plumbless well

   While the phasm of him who fared starts up,
   And of her who was waiting him sobs from near,
   As they haunt there and drink the wormwood cup
   They filled for themselves when their sky was clear.

   Yes, I see those roads—now rutted and bare,
   While over the gate is no sun-glazed sea;
   And though life laughed when I halted there,
   It is where I never again would be.




“AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM”
(ON THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE, Nov. 11, 1918)


                                    I

   THERE had been years of Passion—scorching, cold,
   And much Despair, and Anger heaving high,
   Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold,
   Among the young, among the weak and old,
   And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?”

                                    II

   Men had not paused to answer.  Foes distraught
   Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
   Philosophies that sages long had taught,
   And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
   And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.

                                   III

   The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
   To “dug-outs,” “snipers,” “Huns,” from the war-adept
   In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused;
   To day—dreamt men in millions, when they mused—
   To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.

                                    IV

   Waking to wish existence timeless, null,
   Sirius they watched above where armies fell;
   He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull
   Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull
   Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.

                                    V

   So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
   Were dead and damned, there sounded “War is done!”
   One morrow.  Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,
   “Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly,
   And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?”

                                    VI

   Breathless they paused.  Out there men raised their glance
   To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped,
   As they had raised it through the four years’ dance
   Of Death in the now familiar flats of France;
   And murmured, “Strange, this!  How?  All firing stopped?”

                                   VII

   Aye; all was hushed.  The about-to-fire fired not,
   The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song.
   One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
   And turned.  The Spirit of Irony smirked out, “What?
   Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?”

                                   VIII

   Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray,
   No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn,
   No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray;
   Worn horses mused: “We are not whipped to-day”;
   No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn.

                                    IX

   Calm fell.  From Heaven distilled a clemency;
   There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky;
   Some could, some could not, shake off misery:
   The Sinister Spirit sneered: “It had to be!”
   And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?”




HAUNTING FINGERS
A PHANTASY IN A MUSEUM OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS


            “ARE you awake,
         Comrades, this silent night?
      Well ’twere if all of our glossy gluey make
   Lay in the damp without, and fell to fragments quite!”

            “O viol, my friend,
         I watch, though Phosphor nears,
      And I fain would drowse away to its utter end
   This dumb dark stowage after our loud melodious years!”

   And they felt past handlers clutch them,
      Though none was in the room,
   Old players’ dead fingers touch them,
         Shrunk in the tomb.

            “’Cello, good mate,
         You speak my mind as yours:
      Doomed to this voiceless, crippled, corpselike state,
   Who, dear to famed Amphion, trapped here, long endures?”

            “Once I could thrill
         The populace through and through,
      Wake them to passioned pulsings past their will.” . . .
   (A contra-basso spake so, and the rest sighed anew.)

   And they felt old muscles travel
      Over their tense contours,
   And with long skill unravel
         Cunningest scores.

            “The tender pat
         Of her aery finger-tips
      Upon me daily—I rejoiced thereat!”
   (Thuswise a harpsicord, as from dampered lips.)

            “My keys’ white shine,
         Now sallow, met a hand
      Even whiter. . . .  Tones of hers fell forth with mine
   In sowings of sound so sweet no lover could withstand!”

   And its clavier was filmed with fingers
      Like tapering flames—wan, cold—
   Or the nebulous light that lingers
         In charnel mould.

            “Gayer than most
         Was I,” reverbed a drum;
      “The regiments, marchings, throngs, hurrahs!  What a host
   I stirred—even when crape mufflings gagged me well-nigh dumb!”

            Trilled an aged viol:
         “Much tune have I set free
      To spur the dance, since my first timid trial
   Where I had birth—far hence, in sun-swept Italy!”

   And he feels apt touches on him
      From those that pressed him then;
   Who seem with their glance to con him,
         Saying, “Not again!”

            “A holy calm,”
         Mourned a shawm’s voice subdued,
      “Steeped my Cecilian rhythms when hymn and psalm
   Poured from devout souls met in Sabbath sanctitude.”

            “I faced the sock
         Nightly,” twanged a sick lyre,
      “Over ranked lights!  O charm of life in mock,
   O scenes that fed love, hope, wit, rapture, mirth, desire!”

   Thus they, till each past player
      Stroked thinner and more thin,
   And the morning sky grew grayer
         And day crawled in.




THE WOMAN I MET


   A STRANGER, I threaded sunken-hearted
         A lamp-lit crowd;
   And anon there passed me a soul departed,
         Who mutely bowed.
   In my far-off youthful years I had met her,
   Full-pulsed; but now, no more life’s debtor,
         Onward she slid
      In a shroud that furs half-hid.

   “Why do you trouble me, dead woman,
         Trouble me;
   You whom I knew when warm and human?
         —How it be
   That you quitted earth and are yet upon it
   Is, to any who ponder on it,
         Past being read!”
      “Still, it is so,” she said.

   “These were my haunts in my olden sprightly
         Hours of breath;
   Here I went tempting frail youth nightly
         To their death;
   But you deemed me chaste—me, a tinselled sinner!
   How thought you one with pureness in her
         Could pace this street
      Eyeing some man to greet?

   “Well; your very simplicity made me love you
         Mid such town dross,
   Till I set not Heaven itself above you,
         Who grew my Cross;
   For you’d only nod, despite how I sighed for you;
   So you tortured me, who fain would have died for you!
         —What I suffered then
      Would have paid for the sins of ten!

   “Thus went the days.  I feared you despised me
         To fling me a nod
   Each time, no more: till love chastised me
         As with a rod
   That a fresh bland boy of no assurance
   Should fire me with passion beyond endurance,
         While others all
      I hated, and loathed their call.

   “I said: ‘It is his mother’s spirit
         Hovering around
   To shield him, maybe!’  I used to fear it,
         As still I found
   My beauty left no least impression,
   And remnants of pride withheld confession
         Of my true trade
      By speaking; so I delayed.

   “I said: ‘Perhaps with a costly flower
         He’ll be beguiled.’
   I held it, in passing you one late hour,
         To your face: you smiled,
   Keeping step with the throng; though you did not see there
   A single one that rivalled me there! . . .
         Well: it’s all past.
      I died in the Lock at last.”

   So walked the dead and I together
         The quick among,
   Elbowing our kind of every feather
         Slowly and long;
   Yea, long and slowly.  That a phantom should stalk there
   With me seemed nothing strange, and talk there
         That winter night
      By flaming jets of light.

   She showed me Juans who feared their call-time,
         Guessing their lot;
   She showed me her sort that cursed their fall-time,
         And that did not.
   Till suddenly murmured she: “Now, tell me,
   Why asked you never, ere death befell me,
         To have my love,
      Much as I dreamt thereof?”

   I could not answer.  And she, well weeting
         All in my heart,
   Said: “God your guardian kept our fleeting
         Forms apart!”
   Sighing and drawing her furs around her
   Over the shroud that tightly bound her,
         With wafts as from clay
      She turned and thinned away.

LONDON, 1918.




“IF IT’S EVER SPRING AGAIN”
(SONG)


   IF it’s ever spring again,
      Spring again,
   I shall go where went I when
   Down the moor-cock splashed, and hen,
   Seeing me not, amid their flounder,
   Standing with my arm around her;
   If it’s ever spring again,
      Spring again,
   I shall go where went I then.

   If it’s ever summer-time,
      Summer-time,
   With the hay crop at the prime,
   And the cuckoos—two—in rhyme,
   As they used to be, or seemed to,
   We shall do as long we’ve dreamed to,
   If it’s ever summer-time,
      Summer-time,
   With the hay, and bees achime.




THE TWO HOUSES


            IN the heart of night,
         When farers were not near,
      The left house said to the house on the right,
   “I have marked your rise, O smart newcomer here.”

            Said the right, cold-eyed:
         “Newcomer here I am,
      Hence haler than you with your cracked old hide,
   Loose casements, wormy beams, and doors that jam.

            “Modern my wood,
         My hangings fair of hue;
      While my windows open as they should,
   And water-pipes thread all my chambers through.

            “Your gear is gray,
         Your face wears furrows untold.”
      “—Yours might,” mourned the other, “if you held, brother,
   The Presences from aforetime that I hold.

            “You have not known
         Men’s lives, deaths, toils, and teens;
      You are but a heap of stick and stone:
   A new house has no sense of the have-beens.

            “Void as a drum
         You stand: I am packed with these,
      Though, strangely, living dwellers who come
   See not the phantoms all my substance sees!

            “Visible in the morning
         Stand they, when dawn drags in;
      Visible at night; yet hint or warning
   Of these thin elbowers few of the inmates win.

            “Babes new-brought-forth
         Obsess my rooms; straight-stretched
      Lank corpses, ere outborne to earth;
   Yea, throng they as when first from the ’Byss upfetched.

            “Dancers and singers
         Throb in me now as once;
      Rich-noted throats and gossamered fingers
   Of heels; the learned in love-lore and the dunce.

            “Note here within
         The bridegroom and the bride,
      Who smile and greet their friends and kin,
   And down my stairs depart for tracks untried.

            “Where such inbe,
         A dwelling’s character
      Takes theirs, and a vague semblancy
   To them in all its limbs, and light, and atmosphere.

            “Yet the blind folk
         My tenants, who come and go
      In the flesh mid these, with souls unwoke,
   Of such sylph-like surrounders do not know.”

            “—Will the day come,”
         Said the new one, awestruck, faint,
      “When I shall lodge shades dim and dumb—
   And with such spectral guests become acquaint?”

            “—That will it, boy;
         Such shades will people thee,
      Each in his misery, irk, or joy,
   And print on thee their presences as on me.”




ON STINSFORD HILL AT MIDNIGHT


   I GLIMPSED a woman’s muslined form
      Sing-songing airily
   Against the moon; and still she sang,
      And took no heed of me.

   Another trice, and I beheld
      What first I had not scanned,
   That now and then she tapped and shook
      A timbrel in her hand.

   So late the hour, so white her drape,
      So strange the look it lent
   To that blank hill, I could not guess
      What phantastry it meant.

   Then burst I forth: “Why such from you?
      Are you so happy now?”
   Her voice swam on; nor did she show
      Thought of me anyhow.

   I called again: “Come nearer; much
      That kind of note I need!”
   The song kept softening, loudening on,
      In placid calm unheed.

   “What home is yours now?” then I said;
      “You seem to have no care.”
   But the wild wavering tune went forth
      As if I had not been there.

   “This world is dark, and where you are,”
      I said, “I cannot be!”
   But still the happy one sang on,
      And had no heed of me.




THE FALLOW DEER AT THE LONELY HOUSE


   ONE without looks in to-night
      Through the curtain-chink
   From the sheet of glistening white;
   One without looks in to-night
      As we sit and think
      By the fender-brink.

   We do not discern those eyes
      Watching in the snow;
   Lit by lamps of rosy dyes
   We do not discern those eyes
      Wondering, aglow,
      Fourfooted, tiptoe.




THE SELFSAME SONG


   A BIRD bills the selfsame song,
   With never a fault in its flow,
   That we listened to here those long
      Long years ago.

   A pleasing marvel is how
   A strain of such rapturous rote
   Should have gone on thus till now
      Unchanged in a note!

   —But it’s not the selfsame bird.—
   No: perished to dust is he . . .
   As also are those who heard
      That song with me.




THE WANDERER


   THERE is nobody on the road
      But I,
   And no beseeming abode
      I can try
   For shelter, so abroad
      I must lie.

   The stars feel not far up,
      And to be
   The lights by which I sup
      Glimmeringly,
   Set out in a hollow cup
      Over me.

   They wag as though they were
      Panting for joy
   Where they shine, above all care,
      And annoy,
   And demons of despair—
      Life’s alloy.

   Sometimes outside the fence
      Feet swing past,
   Clock-like, and then go hence,
      Till at last
   There is a silence, dense,
      Deep, and vast.

   A wanderer, witch-drawn
      To and fro,
   To-morrow, at the dawn,
      On I go,
   And where I rest anon
      Do not know!

   Yet it’s meet—this bed of hay
      And roofless plight;
   For there’s a house of clay,
      My own, quite,
   To roof me soon, all day
      And all night.




A WIFE COMES BACK


   THIS is the story a man told me
      Of his life’s one day of dreamery.

      A woman came into his room
   Between the dawn and the creeping day:
   She was the years-wed wife from whom
   He had parted, and who lived far away,
         As if strangers they.

      He wondered, and as she stood
   She put on youth in her look and air,
   And more was he wonderstruck as he viewed
   Her form and flesh bloom yet more fair
         While he watched her there;

      Till she freshed to the pink and brown
   That were hers on the night when first they met,
   When she was the charm of the idle town
   And he the pick of the club-fire set . . .
         His eyes grew wet,

      And he stretched his arms: “Stay—rest!—”
   He cried.  “Abide with me so, my own!”
   But his arms closed in on his hard bare breast;
   She had vanished with all he had looked upon
         Of her beauty: gone.

      He clothed, and drew downstairs,
   But she was not in the house, he found;
   And he passed out under the leafy pairs
   Of the avenue elms, and searched around
         To the park-pale bound.

      He mounted, and rode till night
   To the city to which she had long withdrawn,
   The vision he bore all day in his sight
   Being her young self as pondered on
         In the dim of dawn.

      “—The lady here long ago—
   Is she now here?—young—or such age as she is?”
   “—She is still here.”—“Thank God.  Let her know;
   She’ll pardon a comer so late as this
      Whom she’d fain not miss.”

      She received him—an ancient dame,
   Who hemmed, with features frozen and numb,
   “How strange!—I’d almost forgotten your name!—
   A call just now—is troublesome;
         Why did you come?”




A YOUNG MAN’S EXHORTATION


      CALL off your eyes from care
   By some determined deftness; put forth joys
   Dear as excess without the core that cloys,
      And charm Life’s lourings fair.

      Exalt and crown the hour
   That girdles us, and fill it full with glee,
   Blind glee, excelling aught could ever be
      Were heedfulness in power.

      Send up such touching strains
   That limitless recruits from Fancy’s pack
   Shall rush upon your tongue, and tender back
      All that your soul contains.

      For what do we know best?
   That a fresh love-leaf crumpled soon will dry,
   And that men moment after moment die,
      Of all scope dispossest.

      If I have seen one thing
   It is the passing preciousness of dreams;
   That aspects are within us; and who seems
      Most kingly is the King.

AT LULWORTH COVE A CENTURY BACK


   HAD I but lived a hundred years ago
   I might have gone, as I have gone this year,
   By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,
   And Time have placed his finger on me there:

   “_You see that man_?”—I might have looked, and said,
   “O yes: I see him.  One that boat has brought
   Which dropped down Channel round Saint Alban’s Head.
   So commonplace a youth calls not my thought.”

   “_You see that man_?”—“Why yes; I told you; yes:
   Of an idling town-sort; thin; hair brown in hue;
   And as the evening light scants less and less
   He looks up at a star, as many do.”

   “_You see that man_?”—“Nay, leave me!” then I plead,
   “I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea,
   And it grows dark, and I am weary-kneed:
   I have said the third time; yes, that man I see!

   “Good.  That man goes to Rome—to death, despair;
   And no one notes him now but you and I:
   A hundred years, and the world will follow him there,
   And bend with reverence where his ashes lie.”

_September_ 1920.

_Note_.—In September 1820 Keats, on his way to Rome, landed one day on
the Dorset coast, and composed the sonnet, “Bright star! would I were
steadfast as thou art.”  The spot of his landing is judged to have been
Lulworth Cove.




A BYGONE OCCASION
(SONG)


      THAT night, that night,
      That song, that song!
   Will such again be evened quite
      Through lifetimes long?

      No mirth was shown
      To outer seers,
   But mood to match has not been known
      In modern years.

      O eyes that smiled,
      O lips that lured;
   That such would last was one beguiled
      To think ensured!

      That night, that night,
      That song, that song;
   O drink to its recalled delight,
      Though tears may throng!




TWO SERENADES


I
_On Christmas Eve_


   LATE on Christmas Eve, in the street alone,
   Outside a house, on the pavement-stone,
   I sang to her, as we’d sung together
   On former eves ere I felt her tether.—
   Above the door of green by me
   Was she, her casement seen by me;
      But she would not heed
      What I melodied
      In my soul’s sore need—
      She would not heed.

   Cassiopeia overhead,
   And the Seven of the Wain, heard what I said
   As I bent me there, and voiced, and fingered
   Upon the strings. . . . Long, long I lingered:
   Only the curtains hid from her
   One whom caprice had bid from her;
      But she did not come,
      And my heart grew numb
      And dull my strum;
      She did not come.



II
_A Year Later_


   I SKIMMED the strings; I sang quite low;
   I hoped she would not come or know
   That the house next door was the one now dittied,
   Not hers, as when I had played unpitied;
   —Next door, where dwelt a heart fresh stirred,
   My new Love, of good will to me,
   Unlike my old Love chill to me,
   Who had not cared for my notes when heard:
      Yet that old Love came
      To the other’s name
      As hers were the claim;
      Yea, the old Love came

   My viol sank mute, my tongue stood still,
   I tried to sing on, but vain my will:
   I prayed she would guess of the later, and leave me;
   She stayed, as though, were she slain by the smart,
   She would bear love’s burn for a newer heart.
   The tense-drawn moment wrought to bereave me
   Of voice, and I turned in a dumb despair
   At her finding I’d come to another there.
      Sick I withdrew
      At love’s grim hue
      Ere my last Love knew;
      Sick I withdrew.

From an old copy.




THE WEDDING MORNING


      TABITHA dressed for her wedding:—
      “Tabby, why look so sad?”
   “—O I feel a great gloominess spreading, spreading,
      Instead of supremely glad! . . .

      “I called on Carry last night,
      And he came whilst I was there,
   Not knowing I’d called.  So I kept out of sight,
      And I heard what he said to her:

      “‘—Ah, I’d far liefer marry
      _You_, Dear, to-morrow!’ he said,
   ‘But that cannot be.’—O I’d give him to Carry,
      And willingly see them wed,

      “But how can I do it when
      His baby will soon be born?
   After that I hope I may die.  And then
      She can have him.  I shall not mourn!”




END OF THE YEAR 1912


   YOU were here at his young beginning,
      You are not here at his agèd end;
   Off he coaxed you from Life’s mad spinning,
      Lest you should see his form extend
         Shivering, sighing,
         Slowly dying,
      And a tear on him expend.

   So it comes that we stand lonely
      In the star-lit avenue,
   Dropping broken lipwords only,
      For we hear no songs from you,
         Such as flew here
         For the new year
      Once, while six bells swung thereto.




THE CHIMES PLAY “LIFE’S A BUMPER!”


   “AWAKE!  I’m off to cities far away,”
   I said; and rose, on peradventures bent.
   The chimes played “Life’s a Bumper!” on that day
   To the measure of my walking as I went:
   Their sweetness frisked and floated on the lea,
   As they played out “Life’s a Bumper!” there to me.

   “Awake!” I said.  “I go to take a bride!”
   —The sun arose behind me ruby-red
   As I journeyed townwards from the countryside,
   The chiming bells saluting near ahead.
   Their sweetness swelled in tripping tings of glee
   As they played out “Life’s a Bumper!” there to me.

   “Again arise.”  I seek a turfy slope,
   And go forth slowly on an autumn noon,
   And there I lay her who has been my hope,
   And think, “O may I follow hither soon!”
   While on the wind the chimes come cheerily,
   Playing out “Life’s a Bumper!” there to me.

1913.




“I WORKED NO WILE TO MEET YOU”
(SONG)


   I WORKED no wile to meet you,
      My sight was set elsewhere,
   I sheered about to shun you,
      And lent your life no care.
   I was unprimed to greet you
      At such a date and place,
   Constraint alone had won you
      Vision of my strange face!

   You did not seek to see me
      Then or at all, you said,
   —Meant passing when you neared me,
      But stumblingblocks forbade.
   You even had thought to flee me,
      By other mindings moved;
   No influent star endeared me,
      Unknown, unrecked, unproved!

   What, then, was there to tell us
      The flux of flustering hours
   Of their own tide would bring us
      By no device of ours
   To where the daysprings well us
      Heart-hydromels that cheer,
   Till Time enearth and swing us
      Round with the turning sphere.




AT THE RAILWAY STATION, UPWAY


      “THERE is not much that I can do,
   For I’ve no money that’s quite my own!”
      Spoke up the pitying child—
   A little boy with a violin
   At the station before the train came in,—
   “But I can play my fiddle to you,
   And a nice one ’tis, and good in tone!”

      The man in the handcuffs smiled;
   The constable looked, and he smiled, too,
      As the fiddle began to twang;
   And the man in the handcuffs suddenly sang
         Uproariously:
         “This life so free
         Is the thing for me!”
   And the constable smiled, and said no word,
   As if unconscious of what he heard;
   And so they went on till the train came in—
   The convict, and boy with the violin.




SIDE BY SIDE


   SO there sat they,
   The estranged two,
   Thrust in one pew
   By chance that day;
   Placed so, breath-nigh,
   Each comer unwitting
   Who was to be sitting
   In touch close by.

   Thus side by side
   Blindly alighted,
   They seemed united
   As groom and bride,
   Who’d not communed
   For many years—
   Lives from twain spheres
   With hearts distuned.

   Her fringes brushed
   His garment’s hem
   As the harmonies rushed
   Through each of them:
   Her lips could be heard
   In the creed and psalms,
   And their fingers neared
   At the giving of alms.

   And women and men,
   The matins ended,
   By looks commended
   Them, joined again.
   Quickly said she,
   “Don’t undeceive them—
   Better thus leave them:”
   “Quite so,” said he.

   Slight words!—the last
   Between them said,
   Those two, once wed,
   Who had not stood fast.
   Diverse their ways
   From the western door,
   To meet no more
   In their span of days.




DREAM OF THE CITY SHOPWOMAN


   ’TWERE sweet to have a comrade here,
   Who’d vow to love this garreteer,
   By city people’s snap and sneer
         Tried oft and hard!

   We’d rove a truant cock and hen
   To some snug solitary glen,
   And never be seen to haunt again
         This teeming yard.

   Within a cot of thatch and clay
   We’d list the flitting pipers play,
   Our lives a twine of good and gay
         Enwreathed discreetly;

   Our blithest deeds so neighbouring wise
   That doves should coo in soft surprise,
   “These must belong to Paradise
         Who live so sweetly.”

   Our clock should be the closing flowers,
   Our sprinkle-bath the passing showers,
   Our church the alleyed willow bowers,
         The truth our theme;

   And infant shapes might soon abound:
   Their shining heads would dot us round
   Like mushroom balls on grassy ground . . .
         —But all is dream!

   O God, that creatures framed to feel
   A yearning nature’s strong appeal
   Should writhe on this eternal wheel
         In rayless grime;

   And vainly note, with wan regret,
   Each star of early promise set;
   Till Death relieves, and they forget
         Their one Life’s time!

WESTBOURNE PARK VILLAS, 1866.




A MAIDEN’S PLEDGE
(SONG)


   I DO not wish to win your vow
   To take me soon or late as bride,
   And lift me from the nook where now
   I tarry your farings to my side.
   I am blissful ever to abide
   In this green labyrinth—let all be,
   If but, whatever may betide,
   You do not leave off loving me!

   Your comet-comings I will wait
   With patience time shall not wear through;
   The yellowing years will not abate
   My largened love and truth to you,
   Nor drive me to complaint undue
   Of absence, much as I may pine,
   If never another ’twixt us two
   Shall come, and you stand wholly mine.




THE CHILD AND THE SAGE


   YOU say, O Sage, when weather-checked,
      “I have been favoured so
   With cloudless skies, I must expect
      This dash of rain or snow.”

   “Since health has been my lot,” you say,
      “So many months of late,
   I must not chafe that one short day
      Of sickness mars my state.”

   You say, “Such bliss has been my share
      From Love’s unbroken smile,
   It is but reason I should bear
      A cross therein awhile.”

   And thus you do not count upon
      Continuance of joy;
   But, when at ease, expect anon
      A burden of annoy.

   But, Sage—this Earth—why not a place
      Where no reprisals reign,
   Where never a spell of pleasantness
      Makes reasonable a pain?

_December_ 21, 1908.




MISMET


                                    I

      HE was leaning by a face,
      He was looking into eyes,
      And he knew a trysting-place,
      And he heard seductive sighs;
         But the face,
         And the eyes,
         And the place,
         And the sighs,
   Were not, alas, the right ones—the ones meet for him—
   Though fine and sweet the features, and the feelings all abrim.

                                    II

      She was looking at a form,
      She was listening for a tread,
      She could feel a waft of charm
      When a certain name was said;
         But the form,
         And the tread,
         And the charm
         Of name said,
   Were the wrong ones for her, and ever would be so,
   While the heritor of the right it would have saved her soul to know!




AN AUTUMN RAIN-SCENE


   THERE trudges one to a merry-making
         With a sturdy swing,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   To fetch the saving medicament
         Is another bent,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   One slowly drives his herd to the stall
         Ere ill befall,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   This bears his missives of life and death
         With quickening breath,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   One watches for signals of wreck or war
         From the hill afar,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   No care if he gain a shelter or none,
         Unhired moves one,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   And another knows nought of its chilling fall
         Upon him at all,
      On whom the rain comes down.

_October_ 1904.




MEDITATIONS ON A HOLIDAY
(A NEW THEME TO AN OLD FOLK-JINGLE)


   ’TIS May morning,
   All-adorning,
   No cloud warning
      Of rain to-day.
   Where shall I go to,
   Go to, go to?—
   Can I say No to
      Lyonnesse-way?

   Well—what reason
   Now at this season
   Is there for treason
      To other shrines?
   Tristram is not there,
   Isolt forgot there,
   New eras blot there
      Sought-for signs!

   Stratford-on-Avon—
   Poesy-paven—
   I’ll find a haven
      There, somehow!—
   Nay—I’m but caught of
   Dreams long thought of,
   The Swan knows nought of
      His Avon now!

   What shall it be, then,
   I go to see, then,
   Under the plea, then,
      Of votary?
   I’ll go to Lakeland,
   Lakeland, Lakeland,
   Certainly Lakeland
      Let it be.

   But—why to that place,
   That place, that place,
   Such a hard come-at place
      Need I fare?
   When its bard cheers no more,
   Loves no more, fears no more,
   Sees no more, hears no more
      Anything there!

   Ah, there is Scotland,
   Burns’s Scotland,
   And Waverley’s.  To what land
      Better can I hie?—
   Yet—if no whit now
   Feel those of it now—
   Care not a bit now
      For it—why I?

   I’ll seek a town street,
   Aye, a brick-brown street,
   Quite a tumbledown street,
      Drawing no eyes.
   For a Mary dwelt there,
   And a Percy felt there
   Heart of him melt there,
      A Claire likewise.

   Why incline to _that_ city,
   Such a city, _that_ city,
   Now a mud-bespat city!—
      Care the lovers who
   Now live and walk there,
   Sit there and talk there,
   Buy there, or hawk there,
      Or wed, or woo?

   Laughters in a volley
   Greet so fond a folly
   As nursing melancholy
      In this and that spot,
   Which, with most endeavour,
   Those can visit never,
   But for ever and ever
      Will now know not!

   If, on lawns Elysian,
   With a broadened vision
   And a faint derision
      Conscious be they,
   How they might reprove me
   That these fancies move me,
   Think they ill behoove me,
      Smile, and say:

   “What!—our hoar old houses,
   Where the past dead-drowses,
   Nor a child nor spouse is
      Of our name at all?
   Such abodes to care for,
   Inquire about and bear for,
   And suffer wear and tear for—
      How weak of you and small!”

_May_ 1921.




AN EXPERIENCE


   WIT, weight, or wealth there was not
      In anything that was said,
      In anything that was done;
   All was of scope to cause not
      A triumph, dazzle, or dread
      To even the subtlest one,
         My friend,
      To even the subtlest one.

   But there was a new afflation—
      An aura zephyring round,
      That care infected not:
   It came as a salutation,
      And, in my sweet astound,
      I scarcely witted what
         Might pend,
      I scarcely witted what.

   The hills in samewise to me
      Spoke, as they grayly gazed,
      —First hills to speak so yet!
   The thin-edged breezes blew me
      What I, though cobwebbed, crazed,
      Was never to forget,
         My friend,
      Was never to forget!




THE BEAUTY


   O DO not praise my beauty more,
      In such word-wild degree,
   And say I am one all eyes adore;
      For these things harass me!

   But do for ever softly say:
      “From now unto the end
   Come weal, come wanzing, come what may,
      Dear, I will be your friend.”

   I hate my beauty in the glass:
      My beauty is not I:
   I wear it: none cares whether, alas,
      Its wearer live or die!

   The inner I O care for, then,
      Yea, me and what I am,
   And shall be at the gray hour when
      My cheek begins to clam.

_Note_.—“The Regent Street beauty, Miss Verrey, the Swiss confectioner’s
daughter, whose personal attractions have been so mischievously
exaggerated, died of fever on Monday evening, brought on by the annoyance
she had been for some time subject to.”—London paper, October 1828.




THE COLLECTOR CLEANS HIS PICTURE


    Fili hominis, ecce ego tollo a te desiderabile oculorum tuorom in
    plaga.—EZECH. xxiv. 16.

      HOW I remember cleaning that strange picture!
   I had been deep in duty for my sick neighbour—
   His besides my own—over several Sundays,
   Often, too, in the week; so with parish pressures,
   Baptisms, burials, doctorings, conjugal counsel—
   All the whatnots asked of a rural parson—
   Faith, I was well-nigh broken, should have been fully
   Saving for one small secret relaxation,
   One that in mounting manhood had grown my hobby.

      This was to delve at whiles for easel-lumber,
   Stowed in the backmost slums of a soon-reached city,
   Merely on chance to uncloak some worthy canvas,
   Panel, or plaque, blacked blind by uncouth adventure,
   Yet under all concealing a precious art-feat.
   Such I had found not yet.  My latest capture
   Came from the rooms of a trader in ancient house-gear
   Who had no scent of beauty or soul for brushcraft.
   Only a tittle cost it—murked with grime-films,
   Gatherings of slow years, thick-varnished over,
   Never a feature manifest of man’s painting.

      So, one Saturday, time ticking hard on midnight
   Ere an hour subserved, I set me upon it.
   Long with coiled-up sleeves I cleaned and yet cleaned,
   Till a first fresh spot, a high light, looked forth,
   Then another, like fair flesh, and another;
   Then a curve, a nostril, and next a finger,
   Tapering, shapely, significantly pointing slantwise.
   “Flemish?” I said. “Nay, Spanish . . . But, nay, Italian!”
   —Then meseemed it the guise of the ranker Venus,
   Named of some Astarte, of some Cotytto.
   Down I knelt before it and kissed the panel,
   Drunk with the lure of love’s inhibited dreamings.

      Till the dawn I rubbed, when there gazed up at me
   A hag, that had slowly emerged from under my hands there,
   Pointing the slanted finger towards a bosom
   Eaten away of a rot from the lusts of a lifetime . . .
   —I could have ended myself in heart-shook horror.
   Stunned I sat till roused by a clear-voiced bell-chime,
   Fresh and sweet as the dew-fleece under my luthern.
   It was the matin service calling to me
   From the adjacent steeple.




THE WOOD FIRE
(A FRAGMENT)


   “THIS is a brightsome blaze you’ve lit good friend, to-night!”
   “—Aye, it has been the bleakest spring I have felt for years,
   And nought compares with cloven logs to keep alight:
   I buy them bargain-cheap of the executioners,
   As I dwell near; and they wanted the crosses out of sight
   By Passover, not to affront the eyes of visitors.

   “Yes, they’re from the crucifixions last week-ending
   At Kranion.  We can sometimes use the poles again,
   But they get split by the nails, and ’tis quicker work than mending
   To knock together new; though the uprights now and then
   Serve twice when they’re let stand.  But if a feast’s impending,
   As lately, you’ve to tidy up for the corners’ ken.

   “Though only three were impaled, you may know it didn’t pass off
   So quietly as was wont?  That Galilee carpenter’s son
   Who boasted he was king, incensed the rabble to scoff:
   I heard the noise from my garden.  This piece is the one he was on . . .
   Yes, it blazes up well if lit with a few dry chips and shroff;
   And it’s worthless for much else, what with cuts and stains thereon.”




SAYING GOOD-BYE
(SONG)


   WE are always saying
      “Good-bye, good-bye!”
   In work, in playing,
   In gloom, in gaying:
      At many a stage
      Of pilgrimage
      From youth to age
      We say, “Good-bye,
         Good-bye!”

   We are undiscerning
      Which go to sigh,
   Which will be yearning
   For soon returning;
      And which no more
      Will dark our door,
      Or tread our shore,
      But go to die,
         To die.

   Some come from roaming
      With joy again;
   Some, who come homing
   By stealth at gloaming,
      Had better have stopped
      Till death, and dropped
      By strange hands propped,
      Than come so fain,
         So fain.

   So, with this saying,
      “Good-bye, good-bye,”
   We speed their waying
   Without betraying
      Our grief, our fear
      No more to hear
      From them, close, clear,
      Again: “Good-bye,
         Good-bye!”




ON THE TUNE CALLED THE OLD-HUNDRED-AND-FOURTH


   WE never sang together
      Ravenscroft’s terse old tune
   On Sundays or on weekdays,
   In sharp or summer weather,
      At night-time or at noon.

   Why did we never sing it,
      Why never so incline
   On Sundays or on weekdays,
   Even when soft wafts would wing it
      From your far floor to mine?

   Shall we that tune, then, never
      Stand voicing side by side
   On Sundays or on weekdays? . . .
   Or shall we, when for ever
      In Sheol we abide,

   Sing it in desolation,
      As we might long have done
   On Sundays or on weekdays
   With love and exultation
      Before our sands had run?




THE OPPORTUNITY
(FOR H. P.)


   FORTY springs back, I recall,
      We met at this phase of the Maytime:
   We might have clung close through all,
      But we parted when died that daytime.

   We parted with smallest regret;
      Perhaps should have cared but slightly,
   Just then, if we never had met:
      Strange, strange that we lived so lightly!

   Had we mused a little space
      At that critical date in the Maytime,
   One life had been ours, one place,
      Perhaps, till our long cold daytime.

   —This is a bitter thing
      For thee, O man: what ails it?
   The tide of chance may bring
      Its offer; but nought avails it!




EVELYN G. OF CHRISTMINSTER


   I CAN see the towers
   In mind quite clear
   Not many hours’
   Faring from here;
   But how up and go,
   And briskly bear
   Thither, and know
   That are not there?

   Though the birds sing small,
   And apple and pear
   On your trees by the wall
   Are ripe and rare,
   Though none excel them,
   I have no care
   To taste them or smell them
   And you not there.

   Though the College stones
   Are smit with the sun,
   And the graduates and Dons
   Who held you as one
   Of brightest brow
   Still think as they did,
   Why haunt with them now
   Your candle is hid?

   Towards the river
   A pealing swells:
   They cost me a quiver—
   Those prayerful bells!
   How go to God,
   Who can reprove
   With so heavy a rod
   As your swift remove!

   The chorded keys
   Wait all in a row,
   And the bellows wheeze
   As long ago.
   And the psalter lingers,
   And organist’s chair;
   But where are your fingers
   That once wagged there?

   Shall I then seek
   That desert place
   This or next week,
   And those tracks trace
   That fill me with cark
   And cloy; nowhere
   Being movement or mark
   Of you now there!




THE RIFT
(SONG: _Minor Mode_)


   ’TWAS just at gnat and cobweb-time,
   When yellow begins to show in the leaf,
   That your old gamut changed its chime
   From those true tones—of span so brief!—
   That met my beats of joy, of grief,
      As rhyme meets rhyme.

   So sank I from my high sublime!
   We faced but chancewise after that,
   And never I knew or guessed my crime. . .
   Yes; ’twas the date—or nigh thereat—
   Of the yellowing leaf; at moth and gnat
      And cobweb-time.




VOICES FROM THINGS GROWING IN A CHURCHYARD


   THESE flowers are I, poor Fanny Hurd,
      Sir or Madam,
   A little girl here sepultured.
   Once I flit-fluttered like a bird
   Above the grass, as now I wave
   In daisy shapes above my grave,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   —I am one Bachelor Bowring, “Gent,”
      Sir or Madam;
   In shingled oak my bones were pent;
   Hence more than a hundred years I spent
   In my feat of change from a coffin-thrall
   To a dancer in green as leaves on a wall.
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   —I, these berries of juice and gloss,
      Sir or Madam,
   Am clean forgotten as Thomas Voss;
   Thin-urned, I have burrowed away from the moss
   That covers my sod, and have entered this yew,
   And turned to clusters ruddy of view,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   —The Lady Gertrude, proud, high-bred,
      Sir or Madam,
   Am I—this laurel that shades your head;
   Into its veins I have stilly sped,
   And made them of me; and my leaves now shine,
   As did my satins superfine,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   —I, who as innocent withwind climb,
      Sir or Madam.
   Am one Eve Greensleeves, in olden time
   Kissed by men from many a clime,
   Beneath sun, stars, in blaze, in breeze,
   As now by glowworms and by bees,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily! {128}

   —I’m old Squire Audeley Grey, who grew,
      Sir or Madam,
   Aweary of life, and in scorn withdrew;
   Till anon I clambered up anew
   As ivy-green, when my ache was stayed,
   And in that attire I have longtime gayed
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   —And so they breathe, these masks, to each
      Sir or Madam
   Who lingers there, and their lively speech
   Affords an interpreter much to teach,
   As their murmurous accents seem to come
   Thence hitheraround in a radiant hum,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!




ON THE WAY


      THE trees fret fitfully and twist,
      Shutters rattle and carpets heave,
      Slime is the dust of yestereve,
         And in the streaming mist
   Fishes might seem to fin a passage if they list.

            But to his feet,
            Drawing nigh and nigher
            A hidden seat,
            The fog is sweet
            And the wind a lyre.

      A vacant sameness grays the sky,
      A moisture gathers on each knop
      Of the bramble, rounding to a drop,
         That greets the goer-by
   With the cold listless lustre of a dead man’s eye.

            But to her sight,
            Drawing nigh and nigher
            Its deep delight,
            The fog is bright
            And the wind a lyre.




“SHE DID NOT TURN”


      SHE did not turn,
   But passed foot-faint with averted head
   In her gown of green, by the bobbing fern,
   Though I leaned over the gate that led
   From where we waited with table spread;
         But she did not turn:
   Why was she near there if love had fled?

      She did not turn,
   Though the gate was whence I had often sped
   In the mists of morning to meet her, and learn
   Her heart, when its moving moods I read
   As a book—she mine, as she sometimes said;
         But she did not turn,
   And passed foot-faint with averted head.




GROWTH IN MAY


   I ENTER a daisy-and-buttercup land,
      And thence thread a jungle of grass:
   Hurdles and stiles scarce visible stand
      Above the lush stems as I pass.

   Hedges peer over, and try to be seen,
      And seem to reveal a dim sense
   That amid such ambitious and elbow-high green
      They make a mean show as a fence.

   Elsewhere the mead is possessed of the neats,
      That range not greatly above
   The rich rank thicket which brushes their teats,
      And _her_ gown, as she waits for her Love.

NEAR CHARD.




THE CHILDREN AND SIR NAMELESS


   Sir Nameless, once of Athelhall, declared:
   “These wretched children romping in my park
   Trample the herbage till the soil is bared,
   And yap and yell from early morn till dark!
   Go keep them harnessed to their set routines:
   Thank God I’ve none to hasten my decay;
   For green remembrance there are better means
   Than offspring, who but wish their sires away.”

   Sir Nameless of that mansion said anon:
   “To be perpetuate for my mightiness
   Sculpture must image me when I am gone.”
   —He forthwith summoned carvers there express
   To shape a figure stretching seven-odd feet
   (For he was tall) in alabaster stone,
   With shield, and crest, and casque, and word complete:
   When done a statelier work was never known.

   Three hundred years hied; Church-restorers came,
   And, no one of his lineage being traced,
   They thought an effigy so large in frame
   Best fitted for the floor.  There it was placed,
   Under the seats for schoolchildren.  And they
   Kicked out his name, and hobnailed off his nose;
   And, as they yawn through sermon-time, they say,
   “Who was this old stone man beneath our toes?”




AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY


   THESE summer landscapes—clump, and copse, and croft—
   Woodland and meadowland—here hung aloft,
   Gay with limp grass and leafery new and soft,

   Seem caught from the immediate season’s yield
   I saw last noonday shining over the field,
   By rapid snatch, while still are uncongealed

   The saps that in their live originals climb;
   Yester’s quick greenage here set forth in mime
   Just as it stands, now, at our breathing-time.

   But these young foils so fresh upon each tree,
   Soft verdures spread in sprouting novelty,
   Are not this summer’s, though they feign to be.

   Last year their May to Michaelmas term was run,
   Last autumn browned and buried every one,
   And no more know they sight of any sun.




HER TEMPLE


   DEAR, think not that they will forget you:
      —If craftsmanly art should be mine
   I will build up a temple, and set you
         Therein as its shrine.

   They may say: “Why a woman such honour?”
      —Be told, “O, so sweet was her fame,
   That a man heaped this splendour upon her;
         None now knows his name.”




A TWO-YEARS’ IDYLL


         YES; such it was;
      Just those two seasons unsought,
   Sweeping like summertide wind on our ways;
         Moving, as straws,
      Hearts quick as ours in those days;
   Going like wind, too, and rated as nought
      Save as the prelude to plays
      Soon to come—larger, life-fraught:
         Yes; such it was.

         “Nought” it was called,
      Even by ourselves—that which springs
   Out of the years for all flesh, first or last,
         Commonplace, scrawled
      Dully on days that go past.
   Yet, all the while, it upbore us like wings
      Even in hours overcast:
      Aye, though this best thing of things,
         “Nought” it was called!

         What seems it now?
      Lost: such beginning was all;
   Nothing came after: romance straight forsook
         Quickly somehow
      Life when we sped from our nook,
   Primed for new scenes with designs smart and tall . . .
      —A preface without any book,
      A trumpet uplipped, but no call;
         That seems it now.




BY HENSTRIDGE CROSS AT THE YEAR’S END


(From this centuries-old cross-road the highway leads east to London,
north to Bristol and Bath, west to Exeter and the Land’s End, and south
to the Channel coast.)

      WHY go the east road now? . . .
   That way a youth went on a morrow
   After mirth, and he brought back sorrow
      Painted upon his brow
      Why go the east road now?

      Why go the north road now?
   Torn, leaf-strewn, as if scoured by foemen,
   Once edging fiefs of my forefolk yeomen,
      Fallows fat to the plough:
      Why go the north road now?

      Why go the west road now?
   Thence to us came she, bosom-burning,
   Welcome with joyousness returning . . .
      —She sleeps under the bough:
      Why go the west road now?

      Why go the south road now?
   That way marched they some are forgetting,
   Stark to the moon left, past regretting
      Loves who have falsed their vow . . .
      Why go the south road now?

      Why go any road now?
   White stands the handpost for brisk on-bearers,
   “Halt!” is the word for wan-cheeked farers
      Musing on Whither, and How . . .
      Why go any road now?

      “Yea: we want new feet now”
   Answer the stones.  “Want chit-chat, laughter:
   Plenty of such to go hereafter
      By our tracks, we trow!
      We are for new feet now.”

_During the War_.




PENANCE


   “WHY do you sit, O pale thin man,
      At the end of the room
   By that harpsichord, built on the quaint old plan?
      —It is cold as a tomb,
   And there’s not a spark within the grate;
      And the jingling wires
      Are as vain desires
      That have lagged too late.”

   “Why do I?  Alas, far times ago
      A woman lyred here
   In the evenfall; one who fain did so
      From year to year;
   And, in loneliness bending wistfully,
      Would wake each note
      In sick sad rote,
      None to listen or see!

   “I would not join.  I would not stay,
      But drew away,
   Though the winter fire beamed brightly . . . Aye!
      I do to-day
   What I would not then; and the chill old keys,
      Like a skull’s brown teeth
      Loose in their sheath,
      Freeze my touch; yes, freeze.”




“I LOOK IN HER FACE”
(SONG: _Minor_)


   I LOOK in her face and say,
   “Sing as you used to sing
   About Love’s blossoming”;
   But she hints not Yea or Nay.

   “Sing, then, that Love’s a pain,
   If, Dear, you think it so,
   Whether it be or no;”
   But dumb her lips remain.

   I go to a far-off room,
   A faint song ghosts my ear;
   _Which_ song I cannot hear,
   But it seems to come from a tomb.




AFTER THE WAR


   LAST Post sounded
   Across the mead
   To where he loitered
   With absent heed.
   Five years before
   In the evening there
   Had flown that call
   To him and his Dear.
   “You’ll never come back;
   Good-bye!” she had said;
   “Here I’ll be living,
   And my Love dead!”

   Those closing minims
   Had been as shafts darting
   Through him and her pressed
   In that last parting;
   They thrilled him not now,
   In the selfsame place
   With the selfsame sun
   On his war-seamed face.
   “Lurks a god’s laughter
   In this?” he said,
   “That I am the living
   And she the dead!”




“IF YOU HAD KNOWN”


      IF you had known
   When listening with her to the far-down moan
   Of the white-selvaged and empurpled sea,
   And rain came on that did not hinder talk,
   Or damp your flashing facile gaiety
   In turning home, despite the slow wet walk
   By crooked ways, and over stiles of stone;
      If you had known

      You would lay roses,
   Fifty years thence, on her monument, that discloses
   Its graying shape upon the luxuriant green;
   Fifty years thence to an hour, by chance led there,
   What might have moved you?—yea, had you foreseen
   That on the tomb of the selfsame one, gone where
   The dawn of every day is as the close is,
      You would lay roses!

1920.




THE CHAPEL-ORGANIST
(A.D. 185–)


   I’VE been thinking it through, as I play here to-night, to play never
   again,
   By the light of that lowering sun peering in at the window-pane,
   And over the back-street roofs, throwing shades from the boys of the
   chore
   In the gallery, right upon me, sitting up to these keys once more . . .

   How I used to hear tongues ask, as I sat here when I was new:
   “Who is she playing the organ?  She touches it mightily true!”
   “She travels from Havenpool Town,” the deacon would softly speak,
   “The stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the week.”
   (It fell far short of doing, indeed; but I never told,
   For I have craved minstrelsy more than lovers, or beauty, or gold.)

   ’Twas so he answered at first, but the story grew different later:
   “It cannot go on much longer, from what we hear of her now!”
   At the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his place
   Till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people
   below.
   “A handsome girl,” he would murmur, upstaring, (and so I am).
   “But—too much sex in her build; fine eyes, but eyelids too heavy;
   A bosom too full for her age; in her lips too voluptuous a look.”
   (It may be.  But who put it there?  Assuredly it was not I.)

   I went on playing and singing when this I had heard, and more,
   Though tears half-blinded me; yes, I remained going on and on,
   Just as I used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time! . . .
   For it’s a contralto—my voice is; they’ll hear it again here to-night
   In the psalmody notes that I love more than world or than flesh or
   than life.

   Well, the deacon, in fact, that day had learnt new tidings about me;
   They troubled his mind not a little, for he was a worthy man.
   (He trades as a chemist in High Street, and during the week he had
   sought
   His fellow-deacon, who throve as a book-binder over the way.)
   “These are strange rumours,” he said.  “We must guard the good name of
   the chapel.
   If, sooth, she’s of evil report, what else can we do but dismiss her?”
   “—But get such another to play here we cannot for double the price!”
   It settled the point for the time, and I triumphed awhile in their
   strait,
   And my much-beloved grand semibreves went living on under my fingers.

   At length in the congregation more head-shakes and murmurs were rife,
   And my dismissal was ruled, though I was not warned of it then.
   But a day came when they declared it.  The news entered me as a sword;
   I was broken; so pallid of face that they thought I should faint, they
   said.
   I rallied.  “O, rather than go, I will play you for nothing!” said I.
   ’Twas in much desperation I spoke it, for bring me to forfeit I could
   not
   Those melodies chorded so richly for which I had laboured and lived.
   They paused.  And for nothing I played at the chapel through Sundays
   anon,
   Upheld by that art which I loved more than blandishments lavished of
   men.

   But it fell that murmurs again from the flock broke the pastor’s
   peace.
   Some member had seen me at Havenpool, comrading close a sea-captain.
   (Yes; I was thereto constrained, lacking means for the fare to and
   fro.)
   Yet God knows, if aught He knows ever, I loved the Old-Hundredth,
   Saint Stephen’s,
   Mount Zion, New Sabbath, Miles-Lane, Holy Rest, and Arabia, and Eaton,
   Above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won! . . .
   Next week ’twas declared I was seen coming home with a lover at dawn.
   The deacons insisted then, strong; and forgiveness I did not implore.
   I saw all was lost for me, quite, but I made a last bid in my throbs.
   High love had been beaten by lust; and the senses had conquered the
   soul,
   But the soul should die game, if I knew it!  I turned to my masters
   and said:
   “I yield, Gentlemen, without parlance.  But—let me just hymn you
   _once_ more!
   It’s a little thing, Sirs, that I ask; and a passion is music with
   me!”
   They saw that consent would cost nothing, and show as good grace, as
   knew I,
   Though tremble I did, and feel sick, as I paused thereat, dumb for
   their words.
   They gloomily nodded assent, saying, “Yes, if you care to.  Once more,
   And only once more, understand.”  To that with a bend I agreed.
   —“You’ve a fixed and a far-reaching look,” spoke one who had eyed me
   awhile.
   “I’ve a fixed and a far-reaching plan, and my look only showed it,”
   said I.

   This evening of Sunday is come—the last of my functioning here.
   “She plays as if she were possessed!” they exclaim, glancing upward
   and round.
   “Such harmonies I never dreamt the old instrument capable of!”
   Meantime the sun lowers and goes; shades deepen; the lights are turned
   up,
   And the people voice out the last singing: tune Tallis: the Evening
   Hymn.
   (I wonder Dissenters sing Ken: it shows them more liberal in spirit
   At this little chapel down here than at certain new others I know.)
   I sing as I play.  Murmurs some one: “No woman’s throat richer than
   hers!”
   “True: in these parts, at least,” ponder I.  “But, my man, you will
   hear it no more.”
   And I sing with them onward: “The grave dread as little do I as my
   bed.”

   I lift up my feet from the pedals; and then, while my eyes are still
   wet
   From the symphonies born of my fingers, I do that whereon I am set,
   And draw from my “full round bosom,” (their words; how can _I_ help
   its heave?)
   A bottle blue-coloured and fluted—a vinaigrette, they may conceive—
   And before the choir measures my meaning, reads aught in my moves to
   and fro,
   I drink from the phial at a draught, and they think it a pick-me-up;
   so.
   Then I gather my books as to leave, bend over the keys as to pray.
   When they come to me motionless, stooping, quick death will have
   whisked me away.

   “Sure, nobody meant her to poison herself in her haste, after all!”
   The deacons will say as they carry me down and the night shadows fall,
   “Though the charges were true,” they will add.  “It’s a case red as
   scarlet withal!”
   I have never once minced it.  Lived chaste I have not.  Heaven knows
   it above! . . .
   But past all the heavings of passion—it’s music has been my life-love! . . .
   That tune did go well—this last playing! . . . I reckon they’ll bury
   me here . . .
   Not a soul from the seaport my birthplace—will come, or bestow me . . .
   a tear.




FETCHING HER


      AN hour before the dawn,
            My friend,
   You lit your waiting bedside-lamp,
      Your breakfast-fire anon,
   And outing into the dark and damp
      You saddled, and set on.

      Thuswise, before the day,
            My friend,
   You sought her on her surfy shore,
      To fetch her thence away
   Unto your own new-builded door
      For a staunch lifelong stay.

      You said: “It seems to be,
            My friend,
   That I were bringing to my place
      The pure brine breeze, the sea,
   The mews—all her old sky and space,
      In bringing her with me!”

      —But time is prompt to expugn,
            My friend,
   Such magic-minted conjurings:
      The brought breeze fainted soon,
   And then the sense of seamews’ wings,
      And the shore’s sibilant tune.

      So, it had been more due,
            My friend,
   Perhaps, had you not pulled this flower
      From the craggy nook it knew,
   And set it in an alien bower;
      But left it where it grew!




“COULD I BUT WILL”
(SONG: _Verses_ 1, 3, _key major_; _verse_ 2, _key minor_)


         COULD I but will,
         Will to my bent,
   I’d have afar ones near me still,
   And music of rare ravishment,
   In strains that move the toes and heels!
   And when the sweethearts sat for rest
   The unbetrothed should foot with zest
         Ecstatic reels.

         Could I be head,
         Head-god, “Come, now,
   Dear girl,” I’d say, “whose flame is fled,
   Who liest with linen-banded brow,
   Stirred but by shakes from Earth’s deep core—”
   I’d say to her: “Unshroud and meet
   That Love who kissed and called thee Sweet!—
         Yea, come once more!”

         Even half-god power
         In spinning dooms
   Had I, this frozen scene should flower,
   And sand-swept plains and Arctic glooms
   Should green them gay with waving leaves,
   Mid which old friends and I would walk
   With weightless feet and magic talk
         Uncounted eves.




SHE REVISITS ALONE THE CHURCH OF HER MARRIAGE


   I HAVE come to the church and chancel,
      Where all’s the same!
   —Brighter and larger in my dreams
   Truly it shaped than now, meseems,
      Is its substantial frame.
   But, anyhow, I made my vow,
      Whether for praise or blame,
   Here in this church and chancel
      Where all’s the same.

   Where touched the check-floored chancel
      My knees and his?
   The step looks shyly at the sun,
   And says, “’Twas here the thing was done,
      For bale or else for bliss!”
   Of all those there I least was ware
      Would it be that or this
   When touched the check-floored chancel
      My knees and his!

   Here in this fateful chancel
      Where all’s the same,
   I thought the culminant crest of life
   Was reached when I went forth the wife
      I was not when I came.
   Each commonplace one of my race,
      Some say, has such an aim—
   To go from a fateful chancel
      As not the same.

   Here, through this hoary chancel
      Where all’s the same,
   A thrill, a gaiety even, ranged
   That morning when it seemed I changed
      My nature with my name.
   Though now not fair, though gray my hair,
      He loved me, past proclaim,
   Here in this hoary chancel,
      Where all’s the same.




AT THE ENTERING OF THE NEW YEAR


I
(OLD STYLE)


   OUR songs went up and out the chimney,
   And roused the home-gone husbandmen;
   Our allemands, our heys, poussettings,
   Our hands-across and back again,
   Sent rhythmic throbbings through the casements
      On to the white highway,
   Where nighted farers paused and muttered,
      “Keep it up well, do they!”

   The contrabasso’s measured booming
   Sped at each bar to the parish bounds,
   To shepherds at their midnight lambings,
   To stealthy poachers on their rounds;
   And everybody caught full duly
      The notes of our delight,
   As Time unrobed the Youth of Promise
      Hailed by our sanguine sight.



II
(NEW STYLE)


      WE stand in the dusk of a pine-tree limb,
      As if to give ear to the muffled peal,
      Brought or withheld at the breeze’s whim;
      But our truest heed is to words that steal
      From the mantled ghost that looms in the gray,
      And seems, so far as our sense can see,
      To feature bereaved Humanity,
      As it sighs to the imminent year its say:—

      “O stay without, O stay without,
      Calm comely Youth, untasked, untired;
      Though stars irradiate thee about
      Thy entrance here is undesired.
      Open the gate not, mystic one;
   Must we avow what we would close confine?
   _With thee_, _good friend_, _we would have converse none_,
      Albeit the fault may not be thine.”

_December_ 31.  _During the War_.




THEY WOULD NOT COME


   I TRAVELLED to where in her lifetime
      She’d knelt at morning prayer,
      To call her up as if there;
   But she paid no heed to my suing,
   As though her old haunt could win not
      A thought from her spirit, or care.

   I went where my friend had lectioned
      The prophets in high declaim,
      That my soul’s ear the same
   Full tones should catch as aforetime;
   But silenced by gear of the Present
      Was the voice that once there came!

   Where the ocean had sprayed our banquet
      I stood, to recall it as then:
      The same eluding again!
   No vision.  Shows contingent
   Affrighted it further from me
      Even than from my home-den.

   When I found them no responders,
      But fugitives prone to flee
      From where they had used to be,
   It vouched I had been led hither
   As by night wisps in bogland,
      And bruised the heart of me!




AFTER A ROMANTIC DAY


      THE railway bore him through
         An earthen cutting out from a city:
      There was no scope for view,
   Though the frail light shed by a slim young moon
      Fell like a friendly tune.

      Fell like a liquid ditty,
   And the blank lack of any charm
      Of landscape did no harm.
   The bald steep cutting, rigid, rough,
      And moon-lit, was enough
   For poetry of place: its weathered face
   Formed a convenient sheet whereon
   The visions of his mind were drawn.




THE TWO WIVES
(SMOKER’S CLUB-STORY)


   I WAITED at home all the while they were boating together—
         My wife and my near neighbour’s wife:
      Till there entered a woman I loved more than life,
   And we sat and sat on, and beheld the uprising dark weather,
         With a sense that some mischief was rife.

   Tidings came that the boat had capsized, and that one of the ladies
         Was drowned—which of them was unknown:
      And I marvelled—my friend’s wife?—or was it my own
   Who had gone in such wise to the land where the sun as the shade is?
         —We learnt it was _his_ had so gone.

   Then I cried in unrest: “He is free!  But no good is releasing
         To him as it would be to me!”
      “—But it is,” said the woman I loved, quietly.
   “How?” I asked her.  “—Because he has long loved me too without
   ceasing,
         And it’s just the same thing, don’t you see.”




“I KNEW A LADY”
(CLUB SONG)


   I KNEW a lady when the days
      Grew long, and evenings goldened;
      But I was not emboldened
   By her prompt eyes and winning ways.

   And when old Winter nipt the haws,
      “Another’s wife I’ll be,
      And then you’ll care for me,”
   She said, “and think how sweet I was!”

   And soon she shone as another’s wife:
      As such I often met her,
      And sighed, “How I regret her!
   My folly cuts me like a knife!”

   And then, to-day, her husband came,
      And moaned, “Why did you flout her?
      Well could I do without her!
   For both our burdens you are to blame!”




A HOUSE WITH A HISTORY


   THERE is a house in a city street
      Some past ones made their own;
   Its floors were criss-crossed by their feet,
         And their babblings beat
      From ceiling to white hearth-stone.

   And who are peopling its parlours now?
      Who talk across its floor?
   Mere freshlings are they, blank of brow,
         Who read not how
      Its prime had passed before

   Their raw equipments, scenes, and says
      Afflicted its memoried face,
   That had seen every larger phase
         Of human ways
      Before these filled the place.

   To them that house’s tale is theirs,
      No former voices call
   Aloud therein.  Its aspect bears
         Their joys and cares
      Alone, from wall to wall.




A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS


   I SEE the ghost of a perished day;
   I know his face, and the feel of his dawn:
   ’Twas he who took me far away
      To a spot strange and gray:
   Look at me, Day, and then pass on,
   But come again: yes, come anon!

   Enters another into view;
   His features are not cold or white,
   But rosy as a vein seen through:
      Too soon he smiles adieu.
   Adieu, O ghost-day of delight;
   But come and grace my dying sight.

   Enters the day that brought the kiss:
   He brought it in his foggy hand
   To where the mumbling river is,
      And the high clematis;
   It lent new colour to the land,
   And all the boy within me manned.

   Ah, this one.  Yes, I know his name,
   He is the day that wrought a shine
   Even on a precinct common and tame,
      As ’twere of purposed aim.
   He shows him as a rainbow sign
   Of promise made to me and mine.

   The next stands forth in his morning clothes,
   And yet, despite their misty blue,
   They mark no sombre custom-growths
      That joyous living loathes,
   But a meteor act, that left in its queue
   A train of sparks my lifetime through.

   I almost tremble at his nod—
   This next in train—who looks at me
   As I were slave, and he were god
      Wielding an iron rod.
   I close my eyes; yet still is he
   In front there, looking mastery.

   In the similitude of a nurse
   The phantom of the next one comes:
   I did not know what better or worse
      Chancings might bless or curse
   When his original glossed the thrums
   Of ivy, bringing that which numbs.

   Yes; trees were turning in their sleep
   Upon their windy pillows of gray
   When he stole in.  Silent his creep
      On the grassed eastern steep . . .
   I shall not soon forget that day,
   And what his third hour took away!




HE FOLLOWS HIMSELF


   IN a heavy time I dogged myself
      Along a louring way,
   Till my leading self to my following self
      Said: “Why do you hang on me
         So harassingly?”

   “I have watched you, Heart of mine,” I cried,
      “So often going astray
   And leaving me, that I have pursued,
      Feeling such truancy
         Ought not to be.”

   He said no more, and I dogged him on
      From noon to the dun of day
   By prowling paths, until anew
      He begged: “Please turn and flee!—
         What do you see?”

   “Methinks I see a man,” said I,
      “Dimming his hours to gray.
   I will not leave him while I know
      Part of myself is he
         Who dreams such dree!”

   “I go to my old friend’s house,” he urged,
      “So do not watch me, pray!”
   “Well, I will leave you in peace,” said I,
      “Though of this poignancy
         You should fight free:

   “Your friend, O other me, is dead;
      You know not what you say.”
   —“That do I!  And at his green-grassed door
      By night’s bright galaxy
         I bend a knee.”

   —The yew-plumes moved like mockers’ beards,
      Though only boughs were they,
   And I seemed to go; yet still was there,
      And am, and there haunt we
         Thus bootlessly.




THE SINGING WOMAN


      THERE was a singing woman
         Came riding across the mead
      At the time of the mild May weather,
            Tameless, tireless;
   This song she sung: “I am fair, I am young!”
         And many turned to heed.

      And the same singing woman
         Sat crooning in her need
      At the time of the winter weather;
            Friendless, fireless,
   She sang this song: “Life, thou’rt too long!”
         And there was none to heed.




WITHOUT, NOT WITHIN HER


   IT was what you bore with you, Woman,
      Not inly were,
   That throned you from all else human,
      However fair!

   It was that strange freshness you carried
      Into a soul
   Whereon no thought of yours tarried
      Two moments at all.

   And out from his spirit flew death,
      And bale, and ban,
   Like the corn-chaff under the breath
      Of the winnowing-fan.




“O I WON’T LEAD A HOMELY LIFE”
(_To an old air_)


   “O I won’t lead a homely life
   As father’s Jack and mother’s Jill,
   But I will be a fiddler’s wife,
      With music mine at will!
         Just a little tune,
         Another one soon,
      As I merrily fling my fill!”

   And she became a fiddler’s Dear,
   And merry all day she strove to be;
   And he played and played afar and near,
      But never at home played he
         Any little tune
         Or late or soon;
      And sunk and sad was she!




IN THE SMALL HOURS


   I LAY in my bed and fiddled
      With a dreamland viol and bow,
   And the tunes flew back to my fingers
      I had melodied years ago.
   It was two or three in the morning
      When I fancy-fiddled so
   Long reels and country-dances,
      And hornpipes swift and slow.

   And soon anon came crossing
      The chamber in the gray
   Figures of jigging fieldfolk—
      Saviours of corn and hay—
   To the air of “Haste to the Wedding,”
      As after a wedding-day;
   Yea, up and down the middle
      In windless whirls went they!

   There danced the bride and bridegroom,
      And couples in a train,
   Gay partners time and travail
      Had longwhiles stilled amain! . . .
   It seemed a thing for weeping
      To find, at slumber’s wane
   And morning’s sly increeping,
      That Now, not Then, held reign.




THE LITTLE OLD TABLE


   CREAK, little wood thing, creak,
   When I touch you with elbow or knee;
   That is the way you speak
   Of one who gave you to me!

   You, little table, she brought—
   Brought me with her own hand,
   As she looked at me with a thought
   That I did not understand.

   —Whoever owns it anon,
   And hears it, will never know
   What a history hangs upon
   This creak from long ago.




VAGG HOLLOW


Vagg Hollow is a marshy spot on the old Roman Road near Ilchester, where
“things” are seen.  Merchandise was formerly fetched inland from the
canal-boats at Load-Bridge by waggons this way.

   “WHAT do you see in Vagg Hollow,
   Little boy, when you go
   In the morning at five on your lonely drive?”
   “—I see men’s souls, who follow
   Till we’ve passed where the road lies low,
   When they vanish at our creaking!

   “They are like white faces speaking
   Beside and behind the waggon—
   One just as father’s was when here.
   The waggoner drinks from his flagon,
   (Or he’d flinch when the Hollow is near)
   But he does not give me any.

   “Sometimes the faces are many;
   But I walk along by the horses,
   He asleep on the straw as we jog;
   And I hear the loud water-courses,
   And the drops from the trees in the fog,
   And watch till the day is breaking.

   “And the wind out by Tintinhull waking;
   I hear in it father’s call
   As he called when I saw him dying,
   And he sat by the fire last Fall,
   And mother stood by sighing;
   But I’m not afraid at all!”




THE DREAM IS—WHICH?


   I AM laughing by the brook with her,
      Splashed in its tumbling stir;
   And then it is a blankness looms
      As if I walked not there,
   Nor she, but found me in haggard rooms,
      And treading a lonely stair.

   With radiant cheeks and rapid eyes
      We sit where none espies;
   Till a harsh change comes edging in
      As no such scene were there,
   But winter, and I were bent and thin,
      And cinder-gray my hair.

   We dance in heys around the hall,
      Weightless as thistleball;
   And then a curtain drops between,
      As if I danced not there,
   But wandered through a mounded green
      To find her, I knew where.

_March_ 1913.




THE COUNTRY WEDDING
(A FIDDLER’S STORY)


   LITTLE fogs were gathered in every hollow,
   But the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather
   As we marched with our fiddles over the heather
   —How it comes back!—to their wedding that day.

   Our getting there brought our neighbours and all, O!
   Till, two and two, the couples stood ready.
   And her father said: “Souls, for God’s sake, be steady!”
   And we strung up our fiddles, and sounded out “A.”

   The groomsman he stared, and said, “You must follow!”
   But we’d gone to fiddle in front of the party,
   (Our feelings as friends being true and hearty)
   And fiddle in front we did—all the way.

   Yes, from their door by Mill-tail-Shallow,
   And up Styles-Lane, and by Front-Street houses,
   Where stood maids, bachelors, and spouses,
   Who cheered the songs that we knew how to play.

   I bowed the treble before her father,
   Michael the tenor in front of the lady,
   The bass-viol Reub—and right well played he!—
   The serpent Jim; ay, to church and back.

   I thought the bridegroom was flurried rather,
   As we kept up the tune outside the chancel,
   While they were swearing things none can cancel
   Inside the walls to our drumstick’s whack.

   “Too gay!” she pleaded.  “Clouds may gather,
   And sorrow come.”  But she gave in, laughing,
   And by supper-time when we’d got to the quaffing
   Her fears were forgot, and her smiles weren’t slack.

   A grand wedding ’twas!  And what would follow
   We never thought.  Or that we should have buried her
   On the same day with the man that married her,
   A day like the first, half hazy, half clear.

   Yes: little fogs were in every hollow,
   Though the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather,
   When we went to play ’em to church together,
   And carried ’em there in an after year.




FIRST OR LAST
(SONG)


      IF grief come early
      Joy comes late,
      If joy come early
      Grief will wait;
         Aye, my dear and tender!

   Wise ones joy them early
   While the cheeks are red,
   Banish grief till surly
   Time has dulled their dread.

      And joy being ours
      Ere youth has flown,
      The later hours
      May find us gone;
         Aye, my dear and tender!




LONELY DAYS


   LONELY her fate was,
   Environed from sight
   In the house where the gate was
   Past finding at night.
   None there to share it,
   No one to tell:
   Long she’d to bear it,
   And bore it well.

   Elsewhere just so she
   Spent many a day;
   Wishing to go she
   Continued to stay.
   And people without
   Basked warm in the air,
   But none sought her out,
   Or knew she was there.
   Even birthdays were passed so,
   Sunny and shady:
   Years did it last so
   For this sad lady.
   Never declaring it,
   No one to tell,
   Still she kept bearing it—
   Bore it well.

   The days grew chillier,
   And then she went
   To a city, familiar
   In years forespent,
   When she walked gaily
   Far to and fro,
   But now, moving frailly,
   Could nowhere go.
   The cheerful colour
   Of houses she’d known
   Had died to a duller
   And dingier tone.
   Streets were now noisy
   Where once had rolled
   A few quiet coaches,
   Or citizens strolled.
   Through the party-wall
   Of the memoried spot
   They danced at a ball
   Who recalled her not.
   Tramlines lay crossing
   Once gravelled slopes,
   Metal rods clanked,
   And electric ropes.
   So she endured it all,
   Thin, thinner wrought,
   Until time cured it all,
   And she knew nought.

Versified from a Diary.




“WHAT DID IT MEAN?”


   What did it mean that noontide, when
   You bade me pluck the flower
   Within the other woman’s bower,
      Whom I knew nought of then?

   I thought the flower blushed deeplier—aye,
   And as I drew its stalk to me
   It seemed to breathe: “I am, I see,
   Made use of in a human play.”

   And while I plucked, upstarted sheer
   As phantom from the pane thereby
   A corpse-like countenance, with eye
   That iced me by its baleful peer—
      Silent, as from a bier . . .

   When I came back your face had changed,
      It was no face for me;
   O did it speak of hearts estranged,
      And deadly rivalry

      In times before
      I darked your door,
      To seise me of
      Mere second love,
   Which still the haunting first deranged?




AT THE DINNER-TABLE


   I SAT at dinner in my prime,
   And glimpsed my face in the sideboard-glass,
   And started as if I had seen a crime,
   And prayed the ghastly show might pass.

   Wrenched wrinkled features met my sight,
   Grinning back to me as my own;
   I well-nigh fainted with affright
   At finding me a haggard crone.

   My husband laughed.  He had slily set
   A warping mirror there, in whim
   To startle me.  My eyes grew wet;
   I spoke not all the eve to him.

   He was sorry, he said, for what he had done,
   And took away the distorting glass,
   Uncovering the accustomed one;
   And so it ended?  No, alas,

   Fifty years later, when he died,
   I sat me in the selfsame chair,
   Thinking of him.  Till, weary-eyed,
   I saw the sideboard facing there;

   And from its mirror looked the lean
   Thing I’d become, each wrinkle and score
   The image of me that I had seen
   In jest there fifty years before.




THE MARBLE TABLET


   THERE it stands, though alas, what a little of her
      Shows in its cold white look!
   Not her glance, glide, or smile; not a tittle of her
      Voice like the purl of a brook;
      Not her thoughts, that you read like a book.

   It may stand for her once in November
      When first she breathed, witless of all;
   Or in heavy years she would remember
      When circumstance held her in thrall;
      Or at last, when she answered her call!

   Nothing more.  The still marble, date-graven,
      Gives all that it can, tersely lined;
   That one has at length found the haven
      Which every one other will find;
      With silence on what shone behind.

ST. JULIOT: _September_ 8, 1916.




THE MASTER AND THE LEAVES


                                    I

   WE are budding, Master, budding,
      We of your favourite tree;
   March drought and April flooding
      Arouse us merrily,
   Our stemlets newly studding;
      And yet you do not see!

                                    II

   We are fully woven for summer
      In stuff of limpest green,
   The twitterer and the hummer
      Here rest of nights, unseen,
   While like a long-roll drummer
      The nightjar thrills the treen.

                                   III

   We are turning yellow, Master,
      And next we are turning red,
   And faster then and faster
      Shall seek our rooty bed,
   All wasted in disaster!
      But you lift not your head.

                                    IV

   —“I mark your early going,
      And that you’ll soon be clay,
   I have seen your summer showing
      As in my youthful day;
   But why I seem unknowing
      Is too sunk in to say!”

LAST WORDS TO A DUMB FRIEND


   PET was never mourned as you,
   Purrer of the spotless hue,
   Plumy tail, and wistful gaze
   While you humoured our queer ways,
   Or outshrilled your morning call
   Up the stairs and through the hall—
   Foot suspended in its fall—
   While, expectant, you would stand
   Arched, to meet the stroking hand;
   Till your way you chose to wend
   Yonder, to your tragic end.

   Never another pet for me!
   Let your place all vacant be;
   Better blankness day by day
   Than companion torn away.
   Better bid his memory fade,
   Better blot each mark he made,
   Selfishly escape distress
   By contrived forgetfulness,
   Than preserve his prints to make
   Every morn and eve an ache.

   From the chair whereon he sat
   Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat;
   Rake his little pathways out
   Mid the bushes roundabout;
   Smooth away his talons’ mark
   From the claw-worn pine-tree bark,
   Where he climbed as dusk embrowned,
   Waiting us who loitered round.

   Strange it is this speechless thing,
   Subject to our mastering,
   Subject for his life and food
   To our gift, and time, and mood;
   Timid pensioner of us Powers,
   His existence ruled by ours,
   Should—by crossing at a breath
   Into safe and shielded death,
   By the merely taking hence
   Of his insignificance—
   Loom as largened to the sense,
   Shape as part, above man’s will,
   Of the Imperturbable.

   As a prisoner, flight debarred,
   Exercising in a yard,
   Still retain I, troubled, shaken,
   Mean estate, by him forsaken;
   And this home, which scarcely took
   Impress from his little look,
   By his faring to the Dim
   Grows all eloquent of him.

   Housemate, I can think you still
   Bounding to the window-sill,
   Over which I vaguely see
   Your small mound beneath the tree,
   Showing in the autumn shade
   That you moulder where you played.

_October_ 2, 1904.




A DRIZZLING EASTER MORNING


   AND he is risen?  Well, be it so . . .
   And still the pensive lands complain,
   And dead men wait as long ago,
   As if, much doubting, they would know
   What they are ransomed from, before
   They pass again their sheltering door.

   I stand amid them in the rain,
   While blusters vex the yew and vane;
   And on the road the weary wain
   Plods forward, laden heavily;
   And toilers with their aches are fain
   For endless rest—though risen is he.




ON ONE WHO LIVED AND DIED WHERE HE WAS BORN


   WHEN a night in November
      Blew forth its bleared airs
   An infant descended
      His birth-chamber stairs
      For the very first time,
      At the still, midnight chime;
   All unapprehended
      His mission, his aim.—
   Thus, first, one November,
   An infant descended
      The stairs.

   On a night in November
      Of weariful cares,
   A frail aged figure
      Ascended those stairs
      For the very last time:
      All gone his life’s prime,
   All vanished his vigour,
      And fine, forceful frame:
   Thus, last, one November
   Ascended that figure
      Upstairs.

   On those nights in November—
      Apart eighty years—
   The babe and the bent one
      Who traversed those stairs
      From the early first time
      To the last feeble climb—
   That fresh and that spent one—
      Were even the same:
   Yea, who passed in November
   As infant, as bent one,
         Those stairs.

   Wise child of November!
      From birth to blanched hairs
   Descending, ascending,
      Wealth-wantless, those stairs;
      Who saw quick in time
      As a vain pantomime
   Life’s tending, its ending,
      The worth of its fame.
   Wise child of November,
   Descending, ascending
         Those stairs!




THE SECOND NIGHT
(BALLAD)


   I MISSED one night, but the next I went;
      It was gusty above, and clear;
   She was there, with the look of one ill-content,
      And said: “Do not come near!”

   —“I am sorry last night to have failed you here,
      And now I have travelled all day;
   And it’s long rowing back to the West-Hoe Pier,
      So brief must be my stay.”

   —“O man of mystery, why not say
      Out plain to me all you mean?
   Why you missed last night, and must now away
      Is—another has come between!”

   —“O woman so mocking in mood and mien,
      So be it!” I replied:
   “And if I am due at a differing scene
      Before the dark has died,

   “’Tis that, unresting, to wander wide
      Has ever been my plight,
   And at least I have met you at Cremyll side
      If not last eve, to-night.”

   —“You get small rest—that read I quite;
      And so do I, maybe;
   Though there’s a rest hid safe from sight
      Elsewhere awaiting me!”

   A mad star crossed the sky to the sea,
      Wasting in sparks as it streamed,
   And when I looked to where stood she
      She had changed, much changed, it seemed:

   The sparks of the star in her pupils gleamed,
      She was vague as a vapour now,
   And ere of its meaning I had dreamed
      She’d vanished—I knew not how.

   I stood on, long; each cliff-top bough,
      Like a cynic nodding there,
   Moved up and down, though no man’s brow
      But mine met the wayward air.

   Still stood I, wholly unaware
      Of what had come to pass,
   Or had brought the secret of my new Fair
      To my old Love, alas!

   I went down then by crag and grass
      To the boat wherein I had come.
   Said the man with the oars: “This news of the lass
      Of Edgcumbe, is sharp for some!

   “Yes: found this daybreak, stiff and numb
      On the shore here, whither she’d sped
   To meet her lover last night in the glum,
      And he came not, ’tis said.

   “And she leapt down, heart-hit.  Pity she’s dead:
      So much for the faithful-bent!” . . .
   I looked, and again a star overhead
      Shot through the firmament.




SHE WHO SAW NOT


      “DID you see something within the house
   That made me call you before the red sunsetting?
   Something that all this common scene endows
   With a richened impress there can be no forgetting?”

      “—I have found nothing to see therein,
   O Sage, that should have made you urge me to enter,
   Nothing to fire the soul, or the sense to win:
   I rate you as a rare misrepresenter!”

      “—Go anew, Lady,—in by the right . . .
   Well: why does your face not shine like the face of Moses?”
   “—I found no moving thing there save the light
   And shadow flung on the wall by the outside roses.”

      “—Go yet once more, pray.  Look on a seat.”
   “—I go . . . O Sage, it’s only a man that sits there
   With eyes on the sun.  Mute,—average head to feet.”
   “—No more?”—“No more.  Just one the place befits there,

      “As the rays reach in through the open door,
   And he looks at his hand, and the sun glows through his fingers,
   While he’s thinking thoughts whose tenour is no more
   To me than the swaying rose-tree shade that lingers.”

      No more.  And years drew on and on
   Till no sun came, dank fogs the house enfolding;
   And she saw inside, when the form in the flesh had gone,
   As a vision what she had missed when the real beholding.




THE OLD WORKMAN


   “WHY are you so bent down before your time,
   Old mason?  Many have not left their prime
   So far behind at your age, and can still
      Stand full upright at will.”

   He pointed to the mansion-front hard by,
   And to the stones of the quoin against the sky;
   “Those upper blocks,” he said, “that there you see,
      It was that ruined me.”

   There stood in the air up to the parapet
   Crowning the corner height, the stones as set
   By him—ashlar whereon the gales might drum
      For centuries to come.

   “I carried them up,” he said, “by a ladder there;
   The last was as big a load as I could bear;
   But on I heaved; and something in my back
      Moved, as ’twere with a crack.

   “So I got crookt.  I never lost that sprain;
   And those who live there, walled from wind and rain
   By freestone that I lifted, do not know
      That my life’s ache came so.

   “They don’t know me, or even know my name,
   But good I think it, somehow, all the same
   To have kept ’em safe from harm, and right and tight,
      Though it has broke me quite.

   “Yes; that I fixed it firm up there I am proud,
   Facing the hail and snow and sun and cloud,
   And to stand storms for ages, beating round
      When I lie underground.”




THE SAILOR’S MOTHER


      “O WHENCE do you come,
   Figure in the night-fog that chills me numb?”

   “I come to you across from my house up there,
   And I don’t mind the brine-mist clinging to me
      That blows from the quay,
   For I heard him in my chamber, and thought you unaware.”

      “But what did you hear,
   That brought you blindly knocking in this middle-watch so drear?”

   “My sailor son’s voice as ’twere calling at your door,
   And I don’t mind my bare feet clammy on the stones,
      And the blight to my bones,
   For he only knows of _this_ house I lived in before.”

      “Nobody’s nigh,
   Woman like a skeleton, with socket-sunk eye.”

   “Ah—nobody’s nigh!  And my life is drearisome,
   And this is the old home we loved in many a day
      Before he went away;
   And the salt fog mops me.  And nobody’s come!”

From “To Please his Wife.”




OUTSIDE THE CASEMENT
(A REMINISCENCE OF THE WAR)


      WE sat in the room
      And praised her whom
   We saw in the portico-shade outside:
      She could not hear
      What was said of her,
   But smiled, for its purport we did not hide.

      Then in was brought
      That message, fraught
   With evil fortune for her out there,
      Whom we loved that day
      More than any could say,
   And would fain have fenced from a waft of care.

      And the question pressed
      Like lead on each breast,
   Should we cloak the tidings, or call her and tell?
      It was too intense
      A choice for our sense,
   As we pondered and watched her we loved so well.

      Yea, spirit failed us
      At what assailed us;
   How long, while seeing what soon must come,
      Should we counterfeit
      No knowledge of it,
   And stay the stroke that would blanch and numb?

      And thus, before
      For evermore
   Joy left her, we practised to beguile
      Her innocence when
      She now and again
   Looked in, and smiled us another smile.




THE PASSER-BY
(L. H. RECALLS HER ROMANCE)


   He used to pass, well-trimmed and brushed,
      My window every day,
   And when I smiled on him he blushed,
   That youth, quite as a girl might; aye,
      In the shyest way.

   Thus often did he pass hereby,
      That youth of bounding gait,
   Until the one who blushed was I,
   And he became, as here I sate,
      My joy, my fate.

   And now he passes by no more,
      That youth I loved too true!
   I grieve should he, as here of yore,
   Pass elsewhere, seated in his view,
      Some maiden new!

   If such should be, alas for her!
      He’ll make her feel him dear,
   Become her daily comforter,
   Then tire him of her beauteous gear,
      And disappear!




“I WAS THE MIDMOST”


   I WAS the midmost of my world
      When first I frisked me free,
   For though within its circuit gleamed
      But a small company,
   And I was immature, they seemed
      To bend their looks on me.

   She was the midmost of my world
      When I went further forth,
   And hence it was that, whether I turned
      To south, east, west, or north,
   Beams of an all-day Polestar burned
      From that new axe of earth.

   Where now is midmost in my world?
      I trace it not at all:
   No midmost shows it here, or there,
      When wistful voices call
   “We are fain!  We are fain!” from everywhere
      On Earth’s bewildering ball!




A SOUND IN THE NIGHT
(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–)


   “WHAT do I catch upon the night-wind, husband?—
   What is it sounds in this house so eerily?
   It seems to be a woman’s voice: each little while I hear it,
      And it much troubles me!”

   “’Tis but the eaves dripping down upon the plinth-slopes:
   Letting fancies worry thee!—sure ’tis a foolish thing,
   When we were on’y coupled half-an-hour before the noontide,
      And now it’s but evening.”

   “Yet seems it still a woman’s voice outside the castle, husband,
   And ’tis cold to-night, and rain beats, and this is a lonely place.
   Didst thou fathom much of womankind in travel or adventure
      Ere ever thou sawest my face?”

   “It may be a tree, bride, that rubs his arms acrosswise,
   If it is not the eaves-drip upon the lower slopes,
   Or the river at the bend, where it whirls about the hatches
      Like a creature that sighs and mopes.”

   “Yet it still seems to me like the crying of a woman,
   And it saddens me much that so piteous a sound
   On this my bridal night when I would get agone from sorrow
      Should so ghost-like wander round!”

   “To satisfy thee, Love, I will strike the flint-and-steel, then,
   And set the rush-candle up, and undo the door,
   And take the new horn-lantern that we bought upon our journey,
      And throw the light over the moor.”

   He struck a light, and breeched and booted in the further chamber,
   And lit the new horn-lantern and went from her sight,
   And vanished down the turret; and she heard him pass the postern,
      And go out into the night.

   She listened as she lay, till she heard his step returning,
   And his voice as he unclothed him: “’Twas nothing, as I said,
   But the nor’-west wind a-blowing from the moor ath’art the river,
      And the tree that taps the gurgoyle-head.”

   “Nay, husband, you perplex me; for if the noise I heard here,
   Awaking me from sleep so, were but as you avow,
   The rain-fall, and the wind, and the tree-bough, and the river,
      Why is it silent now?

   “And why is thy hand and thy clasping arm so shaking,
   And thy sleeve and tags of hair so muddy and so wet,
   And why feel I thy heart a-thumping every time thou kissest me,
      And thy breath as if hard to get?”

   He lay there in silence for a while, still quickly breathing,
   Then started up and walked about the room resentfully:
   “O woman, witch, whom I, in sooth, against my will have wedded,
      Why castedst thou thy spells on me?

   “There was one I loved once: the cry you heard was her cry:
   She came to me to-night, and her plight was passing sore,
   As no woman . . . Yea, and it was e’en the cry you heard, wife,
      But she will cry no more!

   “And now I can’t abide thee: this place, it hath a curse on’t,
   This farmstead once a castle: I’ll get me straight away!”
   He dressed this time in darkness, unspeaking, as she listened,
      And went ere the dawn turned day.

   They found a woman’s body at a spot called Rocky Shallow,
   Where the Froom stream curves amid the moorland, washed aground,
   And they searched about for him, the yeoman, who had darkly known her,
      But he could not be found.

   And the bride left for good-and-all the farmstead once a castle,
   And in a county far away lives, mourns, and sleeps alone,
   And thinks in windy weather that she hears a woman crying,
      And sometimes an infant’s moan.




ON A DISCOVERED CURL OF HAIR


   WHEN your soft welcomings were said,
   This curl was waving on your head,
   And when we walked where breakers dinned
   It sported in the sun and wind,
   And when I had won your words of grace
   It brushed and clung about my face.
   Then, to abate the misery
   Of absentness, you gave it me.

   Where are its fellows now?  Ah, they
   For brightest brown have donned a gray,
   And gone into a caverned ark,
   Ever unopened, always dark!

   Yet this one curl, untouched of time,
   Beams with live brown as in its prime,
   So that it seems I even could now
   Restore it to the living brow
   By bearing down the western road
   Till I had reached your old abode.

_February_ 1913.




AN OLD LIKENESS
(RECALLING R. T.)


   WHO would have thought
   That, not having missed her
   Talks, tears, laughter
   In absence, or sought
   To recall for so long
   Her gamut of song;
   Or ever to waft her
   Signal of aught
   That she, fancy-fanned,
   Would well understand,
   I should have kissed her
   Picture when scanned
   Yawning years after!

   Yet, seeing her poor
   Dim-outlined form
   Chancewise at night-time,
   Some old allure
   Came on me, warm,
   Fresh, pleadful, pure,
   As in that bright time
   At a far season
   Of love and unreason,
   And took me by storm
   Here in this blight-time!

   And thus it arose
   That, yawning years after
   Our early flows
   Of wit and laughter,
   And framing of rhymes
   At idle times,
   At sight of her painting,
   Though she lies cold
   In churchyard mould,
   I took its feinting
   As real, and kissed it,
   As if I had wist it
   Herself of old.




HER APOTHEOSIS
“Secretum meum mihi”
(FADED WOMAN’S SONG)


   THERE was a spell of leisure,
      No record vouches when;
   With honours, praises, pleasure
      To womankind from men.

   But no such lures bewitched me,
      No hand was stretched to raise,
   No gracious gifts enriched me,
      No voices sang my praise.

   Yet an iris at that season
      Amid the accustomed slight
   From denseness, dull unreason,
      Ringed me with living light.




“SACRED TO THE MEMORY”
(MARY H.)


   THAT “Sacred to the Memory”
   Is clearly carven there I own,
   And all may think that on the stone
   The words have been inscribed by me
   In bare conventionality.

   They know not and will never know
   That my full script is not confined
   To that stone space, but stands deep lined
   Upon the landscape high and low
   Wherein she made such worthy show.




TO A WELL-NAMED DWELLING


   GLAD old house of lichened stonework,
   What I owed you in my lone work,
      Noon and night!
   Whensoever faint or ailing,
   Letting go my grasp and failing,
      You lent light.

   How by that fair title came you?
   Did some forward eye so name you
      Knowing that one,
   Sauntering down his century blindly,
   Would remark your sound, so kindly,
      And be won?

   Smile in sunlight, sleep in moonlight,
   Bask in April, May, and June-light,
      Zephyr-fanned;
   Let your chambers show no sorrow,
   Blanching day, or stuporing morrow,
      While they stand.




THE WHIPPER-IN


   MY father was the whipper-in,—
      Is still—if I’m not misled?
   And now I see, where the hedge is thin,
      A little spot of red;
      Surely it is my father
      Going to the kennel-shed!

   “I cursed and fought my father—aye,
      And sailed to a foreign land;
   And feeling sorry, I’m back, to stay,
      Please God, as his helping hand.
      Surely it is my father
      Near where the kennels stand?”

   “—True.  Whipper-in he used to be
      For twenty years or more;
   And you did go away to sea
      As youths have done before.
      Yes, oddly enough that red there
      Is the very coat he wore.

   “But he—he’s dead; was thrown somehow,
      And gave his back a crick,
   And though that is his coat, ’tis now
      The scarecrow of a rick;
      You’ll see when you get nearer—
      ’Tis spread out on a stick.

   “You see, when all had settled down
      Your mother’s things were sold,
   And she went back to her own town,
      And the coat, ate out with mould,
      Is now used by the farmer
      For scaring, as ’tis old.”




A MILITARY APPOINTMENT
(SCHERZANDO)


   “SO back you have come from the town, Nan, dear!
   And have you seen him there, or near—
      That soldier of mine—
   Who long since promised to meet me here?”

   “—O yes, Nell: from the town I come,
   And have seen your lover on sick-leave home—
      That soldier of yours—
   Who swore to meet you, or Strike-him-dumb;

   “But has kept himself of late away;
   Yet,—in short, he’s coming, I heard him say—
      That lover of yours—
   To this very spot on this very day.”

   “—Then I’ll wait, I’ll wait, through wet or dry!
   I’ll give him a goblet brimming high—
      This lover of mine—
   And not of complaint one word or sigh!”

   “—Nell, him I have chanced so much to see,
   That—he has grown the lover of me!—
      That lover of yours—
   And it’s here our meeting is planned to be.”




THE MILESTONE BY THE RABBIT-BURROW
(ON YELL’HAM HILL)


   IN my loamy nook
   As I dig my hole
   I observe men look
   At a stone, and sigh
   As they pass it by
   To some far goal.

   Something it says
   To their glancing eyes
   That must distress
   The frail and lame,
   And the strong of frame
   Gladden or surprise.

   Do signs on its face
   Declare how far
   Feet have to trace
   Before they gain
   Some blest champaign
   Where no gins are?




THE LAMENT OF THE LOOKING-GLASS


   WORDS from the mirror softly pass
      To the curtains with a sigh:
   “Why should I trouble again to glass
      These smileless things hard by,
   Since she I pleasured once, alas,
      Is now no longer nigh!”

   “I’ve imaged shadows of coursing cloud,
      And of the plying limb
   On the pensive pine when the air is loud
      With its aerial hymn;
   But never do they make me proud
      To catch them within my rim!

   “I flash back phantoms of the night
      That sometimes flit by me,
   I echo roses red and white—
      The loveliest blooms that be—
   But now I never hold to sight
      So sweet a flower as she.”




CROSS-CURRENTS


   THEY parted—a pallid, trembling I pair,
      And rushing down the lane
   He left her lonely near me there;
      —I asked her of their pain.

   “It is for ever,” at length she said,
      “His friends have schemed it so,
   That the long-purposed day to wed
      Never shall we two know.”

   “In such a cruel case,” said I,
      “Love will contrive a course?”
   “—Well, no . . . A thing may underlie,
      Which robs that of its force;

   “A thing I could not tell him of,
      Though all the year I have tried;
   This: never could I have given him love,
      Even had I been his bride.

   “So, when his kinsfolk stop the way
      Point-blank, there could not be
   A happening in the world to-day
      More opportune for me!

   “Yet hear—no doubt to your surprise—
      I am sorry, for his sake,
   That I have escaped the sacrifice
      I was prepared to make!”




THE OLD NEIGHBOUR AND THE NEW


   ’TWAS to greet the new rector I called I here,
      But in the arm-chair I see
   My old friend, for long years installed here,
      Who palely nods to me.

   The new man explains what he’s planning
      In a smart and cheerful tone,
   And I listen, the while that I’m scanning
      The figure behind his own.

   The newcomer urges things on me;
      I return a vague smile thereto,
   The olden face gazing upon me
      Just as it used to do!

   And on leaving I scarcely remember
      Which neighbour to-day I have seen,
   The one carried out in September,
      Or him who but entered yestreen.




THE CHOSEN


                          “Ατιυά ἐστιν ἀλληγορούμενα

   “A WOMAN for whom great gods might strive!”
      I said, and kissed her there:
   And then I thought of the other five,
      And of how charms outwear.

   I thought of the first with her eating eyes,
   And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,
   And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,
   And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.

   And I thought of the fifth, whom I’d called a jade,
      And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;
   And that each had shown her a passable maid,
      Yet not of the favour sought.

   So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,
   Just at the falling of the mast:
   “After scanning five; yes, each and each,
   I’ve found the woman desired—at last!”

   “—I feel a strange benumbing spell,
      As one ill-wished!” said she.
   And soon it seemed that something fell
      Was starving her love for me.

   “I feel some curse.  O, _five_ were there?”
   And wanly she swerved, and went away.
   I followed sick: night numbed the air,
   And dark the mournful moorland lay.

   I cried: “O darling, turn your head!”
      But never her face I viewed;
   “O turn, O turn!” again I said,
      And miserably pursued.

   At length I came to a Christ-cross stone
   Which she had passed without discern;
   And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,
   And prayed aloud that she might turn.

   I rose, and looked; and turn she did;
      I cried, “My heart revives!”
   “Look more,” she said.  I looked as bid;
      Her face was all the five’s.

   All the five women, clear come back,
   I saw in her—with her made one,
   The while she drooped upon the track,
   And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.

   She’d half forgot me in her change;
      “Who are you?  Won’t you say
   Who you may be, you man so strange,
      Following since yesterday?”

   I took the composite form she was,
   And carried her to an arbour small,
   Not passion-moved, but even because
   In one I could atone to all.

   And there she lies, and there I tend,
      Till my life’s threads unwind,
   A various womanhood in blend—
      Not one, but all combined.




THE INSCRIPTION
(A TALE)


   SIR JOHN was entombed, and the crypt was closed, and she,
   Like a soul that could meet no more the sight of the sun,
   Inclined her in weepings and prayings continually,
      As his widowed one.

   And to pleasure her in her sorrow, and fix his name
   As a memory Time’s fierce frost should never kill,
   She caused to be richly chased a brass to his fame,
      Which should link them still;

   For she bonded her name with his own on the brazen page,
   As if dead and interred there with him, and cold, and numb,
   (Omitting the day of her dying and year of her age
      Till her end should come;)

   And implored good people to pray “Of their Charytie
   For these twaine Soules,”—yea, she who did last remain
   Forgoing Heaven’s bliss if ever with spouse should she
      Again have lain.

   Even there, as it first was set, you may see it now,
   Writ in quaint Church text, with the date of her death left bare,
   In the aged Estminster aisle, where the folk yet bow
      Themselves in prayer.

   Thereafter some years slid, till there came a day
   When it slowly began to be marked of the standers-by
   That she would regard the brass, and would bend away
      With a drooping sigh.

   Now the lady was fair as any the eye might scan
   Through a summer day of roving—a type at whose lip
   Despite her maturing seasons, no meet man
      Would be loth to sip.

   And her heart was stirred with a lightning love to its pith
   For a newcomer who, while less in years, was one
   Full eager and able to make her his own forthwith,
      Restrained of none.

   But she answered Nay, death-white; and still as he urged
   She adversely spake, overmuch as she loved the while,
   Till he pressed for why, and she led with the face of one scourged
      To the neighbouring aisle,

   And showed him the words, ever gleaming upon her pew,
   Memorizing her there as the knight’s eternal wife,
   Or falsing such, debarred inheritance due
      Of celestial life.

   He blenched, and reproached her that one yet undeceased
   Should bury her future—that future which none can spell;
   And she wept, and purposed anon to inquire of the priest
      If the price were hell

   Of her wedding in face of the record.  Her lover agreed,
   And they parted before the brass with a shudderful kiss,
   For it seemed to flash out on their impulse of passionate need,
      “Mock ye not this!”

   Well, the priest, whom more perceptions moved than one,
   Said she erred at the first to have written as if she were dead
   Her name and adjuration; but since it was done
      Nought could be said

   Save that she must abide by the pledge, for the peace of her soul,
   And so, by her life, maintain the apostrophe good,
   If she wished anon to reach the coveted goal
      Of beatitude.

   To erase from the consecrate text her prayer as there prayed
   Would aver that, since earth’s joys most drew her, past doubt,
   Friends’ prayers for her joy above by Jesu’s aid
      Could be done without.

   Moreover she thought of the laughter, the shrug, the jibe
   That would rise at her back in the nave when she should pass
   As another’s avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe
      On the changeless brass.

   And so for months she replied to her Love: “No, no”;
   While sorrow was gnawing her beauties ever and more,
   Till he, long-suffering and weary, grew to show
      Less warmth than before.

   And, after an absence, wrote words absolute:
   That he gave her till Midsummer morn to make her mind clear;
   And that if, by then, she had not said Yea to his suit,
      He should wed elsewhere.

   Thence on, at unwonted times through the lengthening days
   She was seen in the church—at dawn, or when the sun dipt
   And the moon rose, standing with hands joined, blank of gaze,
      Before the script.

   She thinned as he came not; shrank like a creature that cowers
   As summer drew nearer; but still had not promised to wed,
   When, just at the zenith of June, in the still night hours,
      She was missed from her bed.

   “The church!” they whispered with qualms; “where often she sits.”
   They found her: facing the brass there, else seeing none,
   But feeling the words with her finger, gibbering in fits;
      And she knew them not one.

   And so she remained, in her handmaids’ charge; late, soon,
   Tracing words in the air with her finger, as seen that night—
   Those incised on the brass—till at length unwatched one noon,
      She vanished from sight.

   And, as talebearers tell, thence on to her last-taken breath
   Was unseen, save as wraith that in front of the brass made moan;
   So that ever the way of her life and the time of her death
      Remained unknown.

   And hence, as indited above, you may read even now
   The quaint church-text, with the date of her death left bare,
   In the aged Estminster aisle, where folk yet bow
      Themselves in prayer.

_October_ 30, 1907.




THE MARBLE-STREETED TOWN


   I REACH the marble-streeted town,
      Whose “Sound” outbreathes its air
         Of sharp sea-salts;
   I see the movement up and down
         As when she was there.
   Ships of all countries come and go,
      The bandsmen boom in the sun
         A throbbing waltz;
   The schoolgirls laugh along the Hoe
         As when she was one.

   I move away as the music rolls:
      The place seems not to mind
         That she—of old
   The brightest of its native souls—
         Left it behind!
   Over this green aforedays she
      On light treads went and came,
         Yea, times untold;
   Yet none here knows her history—
         Has heard her name.

PLYMOUTH (1914?).




A WOMAN DRIVING


   HOW she held up the horses’ heads,
      Firm-lipped, with steady rein,
   Down that grim steep the coastguard treads,
      Till all was safe again!

   With form erect and keen contour
      She passed against the sea,
   And, dipping into the chine’s obscure,
      Was seen no more by me.

   To others she appeared anew
      At times of dusky light,
   But always, so they told, withdrew
      From close and curious sight.

   Some said her silent wheels would roll
      Rutless on softest loam,
   And even that her steeds’ footfall
      Sank not upon the foam.

   Where drives she now?  It may be where
      No mortal horses are,
   But in a chariot of the air
      Towards some radiant star.




A WOMAN’S TRUST


   IF he should live a thousand years
      He’d find it not again
      That scorn of him by men
   Could less disturb a woman’s trust
   In him as a steadfast star which must
   Rise scathless from the nether spheres:
   If he should live a thousand years
      He’d find it not again.

   She waited like a little child,
      Unchilled by damps of doubt,
      While from her eyes looked out
   A confidence sublime as Spring’s
   When stressed by Winter’s loiterings.
   Thus, howsoever the wicked wiled,
   She waited like a little child
      Unchilled by damps of doubt.

   Through cruel years and crueller
      Thus she believed in him
      And his aurore, so dim;
   That, after fenweeds, flowers would blow;
   And above all things did she show
   Her faith in his good faith with her;
   Through cruel years and crueller
      Thus she believed in him!




BEST TIMES


   WE went a day’s excursion to the stream,
   Basked by the bank, and bent to the ripple-gleam,
         And I did not know
         That life would show,
   However it might flower, no finer glow.

   I walked in the Sunday sunshine by the road
   That wound towards the wicket of your abode,
         And I did not think
         That life would shrink
   To nothing ere it shed a rosier pink.

   Unlooked for I arrived on a rainy night,
   And you hailed me at the door by the swaying light,
         And I full forgot
         That life might not
   Again be touching that ecstatic height.

   And that calm eve when you walked up the stair,
   After a gaiety prolonged and rare,
         No thought soever
         That you might never
   Walk down again, struck me as I stood there.

Rewritten from an old draft.




THE CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE


   WHILE he was here in breath and bone,
      To speak to and to see,
   Would I had known—more clearly known—
      What that man did for me

   When the wind scraped a minor lay,
      And the spent west from white
   To gray turned tiredly, and from gray
      To broadest bands of night!

   But I saw not, and he saw not
      What shining life-tides flowed
   To me-ward from his casual jot
      Of service on that road.

   He would have said: “’Twas nothing new;
      We all do what we can;
   ’Twas only what one man would do
      For any other man.”

   Now that I gauge his goodliness
      He’s slipped from human eyes;
   And when he passed there’s none can guess,
      Or point out where he lies.




INTRA SEPULCHRUM


      WHAT curious things we said,
      What curious things we did
   Up there in the world we walked till dead
      Our kith and kin amid!

      How we played at love,
      And its wildness, weakness, woe;
   Yes, played thereat far more than enough
      As it turned out, I trow!

      Played at believing in gods
      And observing the ordinances,
   I for your sake in impossible codes
      Right ready to acquiesce.

      Thinking our lives unique,
      Quite quainter than usual kinds,
   We held that we could not abide a week
      The tether of typic minds.

      —Yet people who day by day
      Pass by and look at us
   From over the wall in a casual way
      Are of this unconscious.

      And feel, if anything,
      That none can be buried here
   Removed from commonest fashioning,
      Or lending note to a bier:

      No twain who in heart-heaves proved
      Themselves at all adept,
   Who more than many laughed and loved,
      Who more than many wept,

      Or were as sprites or elves
      Into blind matter hurled,
   Or ever could have been to themselves
      The centre of the world.




THE WHITEWASHED WALL


   WHY does she turn in that shy soft way
      Whenever she stirs the fire,
   And kiss to the chimney-corner wall,
      As if entranced to admire
   Its whitewashed bareness more than the sight
      Of a rose in richest green?
   I have known her long, but this raptured rite
      I never before have seen.

   —Well, once when her son cast his shadow there,
      A friend took a pencil and drew him
   Upon that flame-lit wall.  And the lines
      Had a lifelike semblance to him.
   And there long stayed his familiar look;
      But one day, ere she knew,
   The whitener came to cleanse the nook,
      And covered the face from view.

   “Yes,” he said: “My brush goes on with a rush,
      And the draught is buried under;
   When you have to whiten old cots and brighten,
      What else can you do, I wonder?”
   But she knows he’s there.  And when she yearns
      For him, deep in the labouring night,
   She sees him as close at hand, and turns
      To him under his sheet of white.




JUST THE SAME


   I SAT.  It all was past;
   Hope never would hail again;
   Fair days had ceased at a blast,
   The world was a darkened den.

   The beauty and dream were gone,
   And the halo in which I had hied
   So gaily gallantly on
   Had suffered blot and died!

   I went forth, heedless whither,
   In a cloud too black for name:
   —People frisked hither and thither;
   The world was just the same.




THE LAST TIME


   THE kiss had been given and taken,
      And gathered to many past:
   It never could reawaken;
      But you heard none say: “It’s the last!”

   The clock showed the hour and the minute,
      But you did not turn and look:
   You read no finis in it,
      As at closing of a book.

   But you read it all too rightly
      When, at a time anon,
   A figure lay stretched out whitely,
      And you stood looking thereon.




THE SEVEN TIMES


   THE dark was thick.  A boy he seemed at that time
      Who trotted by me with uncertain air;
   “I’ll tell my tale,” he murmured, “for I fancy
      A friend goes there? . . . ”

   Then thus he told.  “I reached—’twas for the first time—
      A dwelling.  Life was clogged in me with care;
   I thought not I should meet an eyesome maiden,
      But found one there.

   “I entered on the precincts for the second time—
      ’Twas an adventure fit and fresh and fair—
   I slackened in my footsteps at the porchway,
      And found her there.

   “I rose and travelled thither for the third time,
      The hope-hues growing gayer and yet gayer
   As I hastened round the boscage of the outskirts,
      And found her there.

   “I journeyed to the place again the fourth time
      (The best and rarest visit of the rare,
   As it seemed to me, engrossed about these goings),
      And found her there.

   “When I bent me to my pilgrimage the fifth time
      (Soft-thinking as I journeyed I would dare
   A certain word at token of good auspice),
      I found her there.

   “That landscape did I traverse for the sixth time,
      And dreamed on what we purposed to prepare;
   I reached a tryst before my journey’s end came,
      And found her there.

   “I went again—long after—aye, the seventh time;
      The look of things was sinister and bare
   As I caught no customed signal, heard no voice call,
      Nor found her there.

   “And now I gad the globe—day, night, and any time,
      To light upon her hiding unaware,
   And, maybe, I shall nigh me to some nymph-niche,
      And find her there!”

   “But how,” said I, “has your so little lifetime
      Given roomage for such loving, loss, despair?
   A boy so young!”  Forthwith I turned my lantern
      Upon him there.

   His head was white.  His small form, fine aforetime,
      Was shrunken with old age and battering wear,
   An eighty-years long plodder saw I pacing
      Beside me there.




THE SUN’S LAST LOOK ON THE COUNTRY GIRL
(M. H.)


   THE sun threw down a radiant spot
      On the face in the winding-sheet—
   The face it had lit when a babe’s in its cot;
   And the sun knew not, and the face knew not
      That soon they would no more meet.

   Now that the grave has shut its door,
      And lets not in one ray,
   Do they wonder that they meet no more—
   That face and its beaming visitor—
      That met so many a day?

_December_ 1915.




IN A LONDON FLAT


                                    I

   “YOU look like a widower,” she said
   Through the folding-doors with a laugh from the bed,
   As he sat by the fire in the outer room,
   Reading late on a night of gloom,
   And a cab-hack’s wheeze, and the clap of its feet
   In its breathless pace on the smooth wet street,
   Were all that came to them now and then . . .
   “You really do!” she quizzed again.

                                    II

   And the Spirits behind the curtains heard,
   And also laughed, amused at her word,
   And at her light-hearted view of him.
   “Let’s get him made so—just for a whim!”
   Said the Phantom Ironic.  “’Twould serve her right
   If we coaxed the Will to do it some night.”
   “O pray not!” pleaded the younger one,
   The Sprite of the Pities.  “She said it in fun!”

                                   III

   But so it befell, whatever the cause,
   That what she had called him he next year was;
   And on such a night, when she lay elsewhere,
   He, watched by those Phantoms, again sat there,
   And gazed, as if gazing on far faint shores,
   At the empty bed through the folding-doors
   As he remembered her words; and wept
   That she had forgotten them where she slept.




DRAWING DETAILS IN AN OLD CHURCH


   I HEAR the bell-rope sawing,
   And the oil-less axle grind,
   As I sit alone here drawing
   What some Gothic brain designed;
   And I catch the toll that follows
      From the lagging bell,
   Ere it spreads to hills and hollows
   Where the parish people dwell.

   I ask not whom it tolls for,
   Incurious who he be;
   So, some morrow, when those knolls for
   One unguessed, sound out for me,
   A stranger, loitering under
      In nave or choir,
   May think, too, “Whose, I wonder?”
   But care not to inquire.




RAKE-HELL MUSES


   YES; since she knows not need,
      Nor walks in blindness,
   I may without unkindness
      A true thing tell:

   Which would be truth, indeed,
      Though worse in speaking,
   Were her poor footsteps seeking
      A pauper’s cell.

   I judge, then, better far
      She now have sorrow,
   Than gladness that to-morrow
      Might know its knell.—

   It may be men there are
      Could make of union
   A lifelong sweet communion—
      A passioned spell;

   But _I_, to save her name
      And bring salvation
   By altar-affirmation
      And bridal bell;

   I, by whose rash unshame
      These tears come to her:—
   My faith would more undo her
      Than my farewell!

   Chained to me, year by year
      My moody madness
   Would wither her old gladness
      Like famine fell.

   She’ll take the ill that’s near,
      And bear the blaming.
   ’Twill pass.  Full soon her shaming
      They’ll cease to yell.

   Our unborn, first her moan,
      Will grow her guerdon,
   Until from blot and burden
      A joyance swell;

   In that therein she’ll own
      My good part wholly,
   My evil staining solely
      My own vile vell.

   Of the disgrace, may be
      “He shunned to share it,
   Being false,” they’ll say.  I’ll bear it;
      Time will dispel

   The calumny, and prove
      This much about me,
   That she lives best without me
      Who would live well.

   That, this once, not self-love
      But good intention
   Pleads that against convention
      We two rebel.

   For, is one moonlight dance,
      One midnight passion,
   A rock whereon to fashion
      Life’s citadel?

   Prove they their power to prance
      Life’s miles together
   From upper slope to nether
      Who trip an ell?

   —Years hence, or now apace,
      May tongues be calling
   News of my further falling
      Sinward pell-mell:

   Then this great good will grace
      Our lives’ division,
   She’s saved from more misprision
      Though I plumb hell.

THE COLOUR


(_The following lines are partly made up_, _partly remembered from a
Wessex folk-rhyme_)

   “WHAT shall I bring you?
   Please will white do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?”
   “—White is for weddings,
   Weddings, weddings,
   White is for weddings,
      And that won’t do.”

   “What shall I bring you?
   Please will red do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?”
   “ —Red is for soldiers,
   Soldiers, soldiers,
   Red is for soldiers,
      And that won’t do.”

   “What shall I bring you?
   Please will blue do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?”
   “—Blue is for sailors,
   Sailors, sailors,
   Blue is for sailors,
      And that won’t do.

   “What shall I bring you?
   Please will green do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?”
   “—Green is for mayings,
   Mayings, mayings,
   Green is for mayings,
      And that won’t do.”

   “What shall I bring you
   Then?  Will black do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?”
   “—Black is for mourning,
   Mourning, mourning,
   Black is for mourning,
      And black will do.”




MURMURS IN THE GLOOM
(NOCTURNE)


   I WAYFARED at the nadir of the sun
   Where populations meet, though seen of none;
      And millions seemed to sigh around
      As though their haunts were nigh around,
      And unknown throngs to cry around
         Of things late done.

   “O Seers, who well might high ensample show”
   (Came throbbing past in plainsong small and slow),
      “Leaders who lead us aimlessly,
      Teachers who train us shamelessly,
      Why let ye smoulder flamelessly
         The truths ye trow?

   “Ye scribes, that urge the old medicament,
   Whose fusty vials have long dried impotent,
      Why prop ye meretricious things,
      Denounce the sane as vicious things,
      And call outworn factitious things
         Expedient?

   “O Dynasties that sway and shake us so,
   Why rank your magnanimities so low
      That grace can smooth no waters yet,
      But breathing threats and slaughters yet
      Ye grieve Earth’s sons and daughters yet
         As long ago?

   “Live there no heedful ones of searching sight,
   Whose accents might be oracles that smite
      To hinder those who frowardly
      Conduct us, and untowardly;
      To lead the nations vawardly
         From gloom to light?”

_September_ 22, 1899.




EPITAPH


   I NEVER cared for Life: Life cared for me,
   And hence I owed it some fidelity.
   It now says, “Cease; at length thou hast learnt to grind
   Sufficient toll for an unwilling mind,
   And I dismiss thee—not without regard
   That thou didst ask no ill-advised reward,
   Nor sought in me much more than thou couldst find.”




AN ANCIENT TO ANCIENTS


   WHERE once we danced, where once sang,
         Gentlemen,
   The floors are sunken, cobwebs hang,
   And cracks creep; worms have fed upon
   The doors.  Yea, sprightlier times were then
   Than now, with harps and tabrets gone,
         Gentlemen!

   Where once we rowed, where once we sailed,
         Gentlemen,
   And damsels took the tiller, veiled
   Against too strong a stare (God wot
   Their fancy, then or anywhen!)
   Upon that shore we are clean forgot,
         Gentlemen!

   We have lost somewhat, afar and near,
         Gentlemen,
   The thinning of our ranks each year
   Affords a hint we are nigh undone,
   That we shall not be ever again
   The marked of many, loved of one,
         Gentlemen.

   In dance the polka hit our wish,
         Gentlemen,
   The paced quadrille, the spry schottische,
   “Sir Roger.”—And in opera spheres
   The “Girl” (the famed “Bohemian”),
   And “Trovatore,” held the ears,
         Gentlemen.

   This season’s paintings do not please,
         Gentlemen,
   Like Etty, Mulready, Maclise;
   Throbbing romance has waned and wanned;
   No wizard wields the witching pen
   Of Bulwer, Scott, Dumas, and Sand,
         Gentlemen.

   The bower we shrined to Tennyson,
         Gentlemen,
   Is roof-wrecked; damps there drip upon
   Sagged seats, the creeper-nails are rust,
   The spider is sole denizen;
   Even she who read those rhymes is dust,
         Gentlemen!

   We who met sunrise sanguine-souled,
         Gentlemen,
   Are wearing weary.  We are old;
   These younger press; we feel our rout
   Is imminent to Aïdes’ den,—
   That evening’s shades are stretching out,
         Gentlemen!

   And yet, though ours be failing frames,
         Gentlemen,
   So were some others’ history names,
   Who trode their track light-limbed and fast
   As these youth, and not alien
   From enterprise, to their long last,
         Gentlemen.

   Sophocles, Plato, Socrates,
         Gentlemen,
   Pythagoras, Thucydides,
   Herodotus, and Homer,—yea,
   Clement, Augustin, Origen,
   Burnt brightlier towards their setting-day,
         Gentlemen.

   And ye, red-lipped and smooth-browed; list,
         Gentlemen;
   Much is there waits you we have missed;
   Much lore we leave you worth the knowing,
   Much, much has lain outside our ken:
   Nay, rush not: time serves: we are going,
         Gentlemen.




AFTER READING PSALMS
XXXIX., XL., ETC.


   SIMPLE was I and was young;
      Kept no gallant tryst, I;
   Even from good words held my tongue,
      _Quoniam Tu fecisti_!

   Through my youth I stirred me not,
      High adventure missed I,
   Left the shining shrines unsought;
      Yet—_me deduxisti_!

   At my start by Helicon
      Love-lore little wist I,
   Worldly less; but footed on;
      Why?  _Me suscepisti_!

   When I failed at fervid rhymes,
      “Shall,” I said, “persist I?”
   “_Dies_” (I would add at times)
      “_Meos posuisti_!”

   So I have fared through many suns;
      Sadly little grist I
   Bring my mill, or any one’s,
      _Domine_, _Tu scisti_!

   And at dead of night I call:
      “Though to prophets list I,
   Which hath understood at all?
      Yea: _Quem elegisti_?”

187–




SURVIEW
“Cogitavi vias meas”


   A CRY from the green-grained sticks of the fire
      Made me gaze where it seemed to be:
   ’Twas my own voice talking therefrom to me
   On how I had walked when my sun was higher—
      My heart in its arrogancy.

   “_You held not to whatsoever was true_,”
      Said my own voice talking to me:
   “_Whatsoever was just you were slack to see_;
   _Kept not things lovely and pure in view_,”
      Said my own voice talking to me.

   “_You slighted her that endureth all_,”
      Said my own voice talking to me;
   “_Vaunteth not_, _trusteth hopefully_;
   _That suffereth long and is kind withal_,”
      Said my own voice talking to me.

   “_You taught not that which you set about_,”
      Said my own voice talking to me;
   “_That the greatest of things is Charity_. . . ”
   —And the sticks burnt low, and the fire went out,
      And my voice ceased talking to me.
MOMENTS OF VISION


         THAT mirror
      Which makes of men a transparency,
         Who holds that mirror
   And bids us such a breast-bare spectacle see
         Of you and me?

         That mirror
      Whose magic penetrates like a dart,
         Who lifts that mirror
   And throws our mind back on us, and our heart,
         Until we start?

         That mirror
      Works well in these night hours of ache;
         Why in that mirror
   Are tincts we never see ourselves once take
         When the world is awake?

         That mirror
      Can test each mortal when unaware;
         Yea, that strange mirror
   May catch his last thoughts, whole life foul or fair,
         Glassing it—where?




THE VOICE OF THINGS


   FORTY Augusts—aye, and several more—ago,
      When I paced the headlands loosed from dull employ,
   The waves huzza’d like a multitude below
      In the sway of an all-including joy
         Without cloy.

   Blankly I walked there a double decade after,
      When thwarts had flung their toils in front of me,
   And I heard the waters wagging in a long ironic laughter
      At the lot of men, and all the vapoury
         Things that be.

   Wheeling change has set me again standing where
      Once I heard the waves huzza at Lammas-tide;
   But they supplicate now—like a congregation there
      Who murmur the Confession—I outside,
         Prayer denied.




“WHY BE AT PAINS?”
(_Wooer’s Song_)


   WHY be at pains that I should know
      You sought not me?
   Do breezes, then, make features glow
      So rosily?
   Come, the lit port is at our back,
      And the tumbling sea;
   Elsewhere the lampless uphill track
      To uncertainty!

   O should not we two waifs join hands?
      I am alone,
   You would enrich me more than lands
      By being my own.
   Yet, though this facile moment flies,
      Close is your tone,
   And ere to-morrow’s dewfall dries
      I plough the unknown.




“WE SAT AT THE WINDOW”
(_Bournemouth_, 1875)


   WE sat at the window looking out,
   And the rain came down like silken strings
   That Swithin’s day.  Each gutter and spout
   Babbled unchecked in the busy way
      Of witless things:
   Nothing to read, nothing to see
   Seemed in that room for her and me
      On Swithin’s day.

   We were irked by the scene, by our own selves; yes,
   For I did not know, nor did she infer
   How much there was to read and guess
   By her in me, and to see and crown
      By me in her.
   Wasted were two souls in their prime,
   And great was the waste, that July time
      When the rain came down.




AFTERNOON SERVICE AT MELLSTOCK
(_Circa_ 1850)


      ON afternoons of drowsy calm
         We stood in the panelled pew,
   Singing one-voiced a Tate-and-Brady psalm
         To the tune of “Cambridge New.”

      We watched the elms, we watched the rooks,
         The clouds upon the breeze,
   Between the whiles of glancing at our books,
         And swaying like the trees.

      So mindless were those outpourings!—
         Though I am not aware
   That I have gained by subtle thought on things
         Since we stood psalming there.




AT THE WICKET-GATE


   THERE floated the sounds of church-chiming,
      But no one was nigh,
   Till there came, as a break in the loneness,
      Her father, she, I.
   And we slowly moved on to the wicket,
      And downlooking stood,
   Till anon people passed, and amid them
      We parted for good.

   Greater, wiser, may part there than we three
      Who parted there then,
   But never will Fates colder-featured
      Hold sway there again.
   Of the churchgoers through the still meadows
      No single one knew
   What a play was played under their eyes there
      As thence we withdrew.




IN A MUSEUM


                                    I

   HERE’S the mould of a musical bird long passed from light,
   Which over the earth before man came was winging;
   There’s a contralto voice I heard last night,
   That lodges in me still with its sweet singing.

                                    II

   Such a dream is Time that the coo of this ancient bird
   Has perished not, but is blent, or will be blending
   Mid visionless wilds of space with the voice that I heard,
   In the full-fugued song of the universe unending.

EXETER.




APOSTROPHE TO AN OLD PSALM TUNE


   I MET you first—ah, when did I first meet you?
   When I was full of wonder, and innocent,
   Standing meek-eyed with those of choric bent,
      While dimming day grew dimmer
         In the pulpit-glimmer.

   Much riper in years I met you—in a temple
   Where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes,
   And you spread over me like a gauze that drapes,
      And flapped from floor to rafters,
         Sweet as angels’ laughters.

   But you had been stripped of some of your old vesture
   By Monk, or another.  Now you wore no frill,
   And at first you startled me.  But I knew you still,
      Though I missed the minim’s waver,
         And the dotted quaver.

   I grew accustomed to you thus.  And you hailed me
   Through one who evoked you often.  Then at last
   Your raiser was borne off, and I mourned you had passed
      From my life with your late outsetter;
         Till I said, “’Tis better!”

   But you waylaid me.  I rose and went as a ghost goes,
   And said, eyes-full “I’ll never hear it again!
   It is overmuch for scathed and memoried men
      When sitting among strange people
         Under their steeple.”

   Now, a new stirrer of tones calls you up before me
   And wakes your speech, as she of Endor did
   (When sought by Saul who, in disguises hid,
      Fell down on the earth to hear it)
         Samuel’s spirit.

   So, your quired oracles beat till they make me tremble
   As I discern your mien in the old attire,
   Here in these turmoiled years of belligerent fire
      Living still on—and onward, maybe,
         Till Doom’s great day be!

_Sunday_, _August_ 13, 1916.




AT THE WORD “FAREWELL”


   SHE looked like a bird from a cloud
      On the clammy lawn,
   Moving alone, bare-browed
      In the dim of dawn.
   The candles alight in the room
      For my parting meal
   Made all things withoutdoors loom
      Strange, ghostly, unreal.

   The hour itself was a ghost,
      And it seemed to me then
   As of chances the chance furthermost
      I should see her again.
   I beheld not where all was so fleet
      That a Plan of the past
   Which had ruled us from birthtime to meet
      Was in working at last:

   No prelude did I there perceive
      To a drama at all,
   Or foreshadow what fortune might weave
      From beginnings so small;
   But I rose as if quicked by a spur
      I was bound to obey,
   And stepped through the casement to her
      Still alone in the gray.

   “I am leaving you . . . Farewell!” I said,
      As I followed her on
   By an alley bare boughs overspread;
      “I soon must be gone!”
   Even then the scale might have been turned
      Against love by a feather,
   —But crimson one cheek of hers burned
      When we came in together.




FIRST SIGHT OF HER AND AFTER


   A DAY is drawing to its fall
      I had not dreamed to see;
   The first of many to enthrall
      My spirit, will it be?
   Or is this eve the end of all
      Such new delight for me?

   I journey home: the pattern grows
      Of moonshades on the way:
   “Soon the first quarter, I suppose,”
      Sky-glancing travellers say;
   I realize that it, for those,
      Has been a common day.




THE RIVAL


      I DETERMINED to find out whose it was—
      The portrait he looked at so, and sighed;
   Bitterly have I rued my meanness
         And wept for it since he died!

      I searched his desk when he was away,
      And there was the likeness—yes, my own!
   Taken when I was the season’s fairest,
         And time-lines all unknown.

      I smiled at my image, and put it back,
      And he went on cherishing it, until
   I was chafed that he loved not the me then living,
         But that past woman still.

      Well, such was my jealousy at last,
      I destroyed that face of the former me;
   Could you ever have dreamed the heart of woman
         Would work so foolishly!




HEREDITY


   I AM the family face;
   Flesh perishes, I live on,
   Projecting trait and trace
   Through time to times anon,
   And leaping from place to place
   Over oblivion.

   The years-heired feature that can
   In curve and voice and eye
   Despise the human span
   Of durance—that is I;
   The eternal thing in man,
   That heeds no call to die.




“YOU WERE THE SORT THAT MEN FORGET”


      YOU were the sort that men forget;
         Though I—not yet!—
   Perhaps not ever.  Your slighted weakness
      Adds to the strength of my regret!

      You’d not the art—you never had
         For good or bad—
   To make men see how sweet your meaning,
      Which, visible, had charmed them glad.

      You would, by words inept let fall,
         Offend them all,
   Even if they saw your warm devotion
      Would hold your life’s blood at their call.

      You lacked the eye to understand
         Those friends offhand
   Whose mode was crude, though whose dim purport
      Outpriced the courtesies of the bland.

      I am now the only being who
         Remembers you
   It may be.  What a waste that Nature
      Grudged soul so dear the art its due!




SHE, I, AND THEY


         I WAS sitting,
         She was knitting,
   And the portraits of our fore-folk hung around;
      When there struck on us a sigh;
      “Ah—what is that?” said I:
   “Was it not you?” said she.  “A sigh did sound.”

         I had not breathed it,
         Nor the night-wind heaved it,
   And how it came to us we could not guess;
      And we looked up at each face
      Framed and glazed there in its place,
   Still hearkening; but thenceforth was silentness.

         Half in dreaming,
         “Then its meaning,”
   Said we, “must be surely this; that they repine
      That we should be the last
      Of stocks once unsurpassed,
   And unable to keep up their sturdy line.”

1916.




NEAR LANIVET, 1872


   THERE was a stunted handpost just on the crest,
      Only a few feet high:
   She was tired, and we stopped in the twilight-time for her rest,
      At the crossways close thereby.

   She leant back, being so weary, against its stem,
      And laid her arms on its own,
   Each open palm stretched out to each end of them,
      Her sad face sideways thrown.

   Her white-clothed form at this dim-lit cease of day
      Made her look as one crucified
   In my gaze at her from the midst of the dusty way,
      And hurriedly “Don’t,” I cried.

   I do not think she heard.  Loosing thence she said,
      As she stepped forth ready to go,
   “I am rested now.—Something strange came into my head;
      I wish I had not leant so!”

   And wordless we moved onward down from the hill
      In the west cloud’s murked obscure,
   And looking back we could see the handpost still
      In the solitude of the moor.

   “It struck her too,” I thought, for as if afraid
      She heavily breathed as we trailed;
   Till she said, “I did not think how ’twould look in the shade,
      When I leant there like one nailed.”

   I, lightly: “There’s nothing in it.  For _you_, anyhow!”
      —“O I know there is not,” said she . . .
   “Yet I wonder . . . If no one is bodily crucified now,
      In spirit one may be!”

   And we dragged on and on, while we seemed to see
      In the running of Time’s far glass
   Her crucified, as she had wondered if she might be
      Some day.—Alas, alas!




JOYS OF MEMORY


      WHEN the spring comes round, and a certain day
   Looks out from the brume by the eastern copsetrees
            And says, Remember,
         I begin again, as if it were new,
         A day of like date I once lived through,
         Whiling it hour by hour away;
            So shall I do till my December,
               When spring comes round.

      I take my holiday then and my rest
   Away from the dun life here about me,
            Old hours re-greeting
         With the quiet sense that bring they must
         Such throbs as at first, till I house with dust,
         And in the numbness my heartsome zest
            For things that were, be past repeating
               When spring comes round.




TO THE MOON


      “WHAT have you looked at, Moon,
         In your time,
      Now long past your prime?”
   “O, I have looked at, often looked at
         Sweet, sublime,
   Sore things, shudderful, night and noon
         In my time.”

      “What have you mused on, Moon,
         In your day,
      So aloof, so far away?”
   “O, I have mused on, often mused on
         Growth, decay,
   Nations alive, dead, mad, aswoon,
         In my day!”

      “Have you much wondered, Moon,
         On your rounds,
      Self-wrapt, beyond Earth’s bounds?”
   “Yea, I have wondered, often wondered
         At the sounds
   Reaching me of the human tune
         On my rounds.”

      “What do you think of it, Moon,
         As you go?
      Is Life much, or no?”
   “O, I think of it, often think of it
         As a show
   God ought surely to shut up soon,
         As I go.”




COPYING ARCHITECTURE IN AN OLD MINSTER
(_Wimborne_)


      HOW smartly the quarters of the hour march by
         That the jack-o’-clock never forgets;
      Ding-dong; and before I have traced a cusp’s eye,
   Or got the true twist of the ogee over,
            A double ding-dong ricochetts.

      Just so did he clang here before I came,
         And so will he clang when I’m gone
      Through the Minster’s cavernous hollows—the same
   Tale of hours never more to be will he deliver
         To the speechless midnight and dawn!

      I grow to conceive it a call to ghosts,
         Whose mould lies below and around.
      Yes; the next “Come, come,” draws them out from their posts,
   And they gather, and one shade appears, and another,
         As the eve-damps creep from the ground.

      See—a Courtenay stands by his quatre-foiled tomb,
         And a Duke and his Duchess near;
      And one Sir Edmund in columned gloom,
   And a Saxon king by the presbytery chamber;
         And shapes unknown in the rear.

      Maybe they have met for a parle on some plan
         To better ail-stricken mankind;
      I catch their cheepings, though thinner than
   The overhead creak of a passager’s pinion
         When leaving land behind.

      Or perhaps they speak to the yet unborn,
         And caution them not to come
      To a world so ancient and trouble-torn,
   Of foiled intents, vain lovingkindness,
         And ardours chilled and numb.

      They waste to fog as I stir and stand,
         And move from the arched recess,
      And pick up the drawing that slipped from my hand,
   And feel for the pencil I dropped in the cranny
         In a moment’s forgetfulness.




TO SHAKESPEARE
AFTER THREE HUNDRED YEARS


      BRIGHT baffling Soul, least capturable of themes,
      Thou, who display’dst a life of common-place,
      Leaving no intimate word or personal trace
      Of high design outside the artistry
         Of thy penned dreams,
   Still shalt remain at heart unread eternally.

      Through human orbits thy discourse to-day,
      Despite thy formal pilgrimage, throbs on
      In harmonies that cow Oblivion,
      And, like the wind, with all-uncared effect
         Maintain a sway
   Not fore-desired, in tracks unchosen and unchecked.

      And yet, at thy last breath, with mindless note
      The borough clocks but samely tongued the hour,
      The Avon just as always glassed the tower,
      Thy age was published on thy passing-bell
         But in due rote
   With other dwellers’ deaths accorded a like knell.

      And at the strokes some townsman (met, maybe,
      And thereon queried by some squire’s good dame
      Driving in shopward) may have given thy name,
      With, “Yes, a worthy man and well-to-do;
         Though, as for me,
   I knew him but by just a neighbour’s nod, ’tis true.

      “I’ faith, few knew him much here, save by word,
      He having elsewhere led his busier life;
      Though to be sure he left with us his wife.”
      —“Ah, one of the tradesmen’s sons, I now recall . . .
         Witty, I’ve heard . . .
   We did not know him . . . Well, good-day.  Death comes to all.”

      So, like a strange bright bird we sometimes find
      To mingle with the barn-door brood awhile,
      Then vanish from their homely domicile—
      Into man’s poesy, we wot not whence,
         Flew thy strange mind,
   Lodged there a radiant guest, and sped for ever thence.

1916.




QUID HIC AGIS?


                                    I

   WHEN I weekly knew
   An ancient pew,
   And murmured there
   The forms of prayer
   And thanks and praise
   In the ancient ways,
   And heard read out
   During August drought
   That chapter from Kings
   Harvest-time brings;
   —How the prophet, broken
   By griefs unspoken,
   Went heavily away
   To fast and to pray,
   And, while waiting to die,
   The Lord passed by,
   And a whirlwind and fire
   Drew nigher and nigher,
   And a small voice anon
   Bade him up and be gone,—
   I did not apprehend
   As I sat to the end
   And watched for her smile
   Across the sunned aisle,
   That this tale of a seer
   Which came once a year
   Might, when sands were heaping,
   Be like a sweat creeping,
   Or in any degree
   Bear on her or on me!

                                    II

   When later, by chance
   Of circumstance,
   It befel me to read
   On a hot afternoon
   At the lectern there
   The selfsame words
   As the lesson decreed,
   To the gathered few
   From the hamlets near—
   Folk of flocks and herds
   Sitting half aswoon,
   Who listened thereto
   As women and men
   Not overmuch
   Concerned at such—
   So, like them then,
   I did not see
   What drought might be
   With me, with her,
   As the Kalendar
   Moved on, and Time
   Devoured our prime.

                                   III

   But now, at last,
   When our glory has passed,
   And there is no smile
   From her in the aisle,
   But where it once shone
   A marble, men say,
   With her name thereon
   Is discerned to-day;
   And spiritless
   In the wilderness
   I shrink from sight
   And desire the night,
   (Though, as in old wise,
   I might still arise,
   Go forth, and stand
   And prophesy in the land),
   I feel the shake
   Of wind and earthquake,
   And consuming fire
   Nigher and nigher,
   And the voice catch clear,
   “What doest thou here?”

_The Spectator_ 1916.  During the War.




ON A MIDSUMMER EVE


   I IDLY cut a parsley stalk,
   And blew therein towards the moon;
   I had not thought what ghosts would walk
   With shivering footsteps to my tune.

   I went, and knelt, and scooped my hand
   As if to drink, into the brook,
   And a faint figure seemed to stand
   Above me, with the bygone look.

   I lipped rough rhymes of chance, not choice,
   I thought not what my words might be;
   There came into my ear a voice
   That turned a tenderer verse for me.




TIMING HER
(_Written to an old folk-tune_)


   LALAGE’S coming:
   Where is she now, O?
   Turning to bow, O,
   And smile, is she,
   Just at parting,
   Parting, parting,
   As she is starting
   To come to me?

   Where is she now, O,
   Now, and now, O,
   Shadowing a bough, O,
   Of hedge or tree
   As she is rushing,
   Rushing, rushing,
   Gossamers brushing
   To come to me?

   Lalage’s coming;
   Where is she now, O;
   Climbing the brow, O,
   Of hills I see?
   Yes, she is nearing,
   Nearing, nearing,
   Weather unfearing
   To come to me.

   Near is she now, O,
   Now, and now, O;
   Milk the rich cow, O,
   Forward the tea;
   Shake the down bed for her,
   Linen sheets spread for her,
   Drape round the head for her
   Coming to me.

   Lalage’s coming,
   She’s nearer now, O,
   End anyhow, O,
   To-day’s husbandry!
   Would a gilt chair were mine,
   Slippers of vair were mine,
   Brushes for hair were mine
   Of ivory!

   What will she think, O,
   She who’s so comely,
   Viewing how homely
   A sort are we!
   Nothing resplendent,
   No prompt attendant,
   Not one dependent
   Pertaining to me!

   Lalage’s coming;
   Where is she now, O?
   Fain I’d avow, O,
   Full honestly
   Nought here’s enough for her,
   All is too rough for her,
   Even my love for her
   Poor in degree.

   She’s nearer now, O,
   Still nearer now, O,
   She ’tis, I vow, O,
   Passing the lea.
   Rush down to meet her there,
   Call out and greet her there,
   Never a sweeter there
   Crossed to me!

   Lalage’s come; aye,
   Come is she now, O! . . .
   Does Heaven allow, O,
   A meeting to be?
   Yes, she is here now,
   Here now, here now,
   Nothing to fear now,
   Here’s Lalage!




BEFORE KNOWLEDGE


   WHEN I walked roseless tracks and wide,
   Ere dawned your date for meeting me,
   O why did you not cry Halloo
   Across the stretch between, and say:

   “We move, while years as yet divide,
   On closing lines which—though it be
   You know me not nor I know you—
   Will intersect and join some day!”

      Then well I had borne
      Each scraping thorn;
      But the winters froze,
      And grew no rose;
      No bridge bestrode
      The gap at all;
      No shape you showed,
      And I heard no call!




THE BLINDED BIRD


   SO zestfully canst thou sing?
   And all this indignity,
   With God’s consent, on thee!
   Blinded ere yet a-wing
   By the red-hot needle thou,
   I stand and wonder how
   So zestfully thou canst sing!

   Resenting not such wrong,
   Thy grievous pain forgot,
   Eternal dark thy lot,
   Groping thy whole life long;
   After that stab of fire;
   Enjailed in pitiless wire;
   Resenting not such wrong!

   Who hath charity?  This bird.
   Who suffereth long and is kind,
   Is not provoked, though blind
   And alive ensepulchred?
   Who hopeth, endureth all things?
   Who thinketh no evil, but sings?
   Who is divine?  This bird.




“THE WIND BLEW WORDS”


   THE wind blew words along the skies,
      And these it blew to me
   Through the wide dusk: “Lift up your eyes,
      Behold this troubled tree,
   Complaining as it sways and plies;
      It is a limb of thee.

   “Yea, too, the creatures sheltering round—
      Dumb figures, wild and tame,
   Yea, too, thy fellows who abound—
      Either of speech the same
   Or far and strange—black, dwarfed, and browned,
      They are stuff of thy own frame.”

   I moved on in a surging awe
      Of inarticulateness
   At the pathetic Me I saw
      In all his huge distress,
   Making self-slaughter of the law
      To kill, break, or suppress.




THE FADED FACE


   HOW was this I did not see
   Such a look as here was shown
   Ere its womanhood had blown
   Past its first felicity?—
   That I did not know you young,
      Faded Face,
         Know you young!

   Why did Time so ill bestead
   That I heard no voice of yours
   Hail from out the curved contours
   Of those lips when rosy red;
   Weeted not the songs they sung,
      Faded Face,
         Songs they sung!

   By these blanchings, blooms of old,
   And the relics of your voice—
   Leavings rare of rich and choice
   From your early tone and mould—
   Let me mourn,—aye, sorrow-wrung,
      Faded Face,
         Sorrow-wrung!




THE RIDDLE


                                    I

   STRETCHING eyes west
   Over the sea,
   Wind foul or fair,
   Always stood she
   Prospect-impressed;
   Solely out there
   Did her gaze rest,
   Never elsewhere
   Seemed charm to be.

                                    II

   Always eyes east
   Ponders she now—
   As in devotion—
   Hills of blank brow
   Where no waves plough.
   Never the least
   Room for emotion
   Drawn from the ocean
   Does she allow.




THE DUEL


         “I AM here to time, you see;
   The glade is well-screened—eh?—against alarm;
      Fit place to vindicate by my arm
      The honour of my spotless wife,
      Who scorns your libel upon her life
         In boasting intimacy!

         “‘All hush-offerings you’ll spurn,
   My husband.  Two must come; one only go,’
      She said.  ‘That he’ll be you I know;
      To faith like ours Heaven will be just,
      And I shall abide in fullest trust
         Your speedy glad return.’”

      “Good.  Here am also I;
   And we’ll proceed without more waste of words
      To warm your cockpit.  Of the swords
      Take you your choice.  I shall thereby
      Feel that on me no blame can lie,
         Whatever Fate accords.”

      So stripped they there, and fought,
   And the swords clicked and scraped, and the onsets sped;
      Till the husband fell; and his shirt was red
      With streams from his heart’s hot cistern.  Nought
      Could save him now; and the other, wrought
         Maybe to pity, said:

      “Why did you urge on this?
   Your wife assured you; and ’t had better been
      That you had let things pass, serene
      In confidence of long-tried bliss,
      Holding there could be nought amiss
         In what my words might mean.”

      Then, seeing nor ruth nor rage
   Could move his foeman more—now Death’s deaf thrall—
      He wiped his steel, and, with a call
      Like turtledove to dove, swift broke
      Into the copse, where under an oak
         His horse cropt, held by a page.

      “All’s over, Sweet,” he cried
   To the wife, thus guised; for the young page was she.
      “’Tis as we hoped and said ’t would be.
      He never guessed . . . We mount and ride
      To where our love can reign uneyed.
         He’s clay, and we are free.”




AT MAYFAIR LODGINGS


   HOW could I be aware,
   The opposite window eyeing
   As I lay listless there,
   That through its blinds was dying
   One I had rated rare
   Before I had set me sighing
   For another more fair?

   Had the house-front been glass,
   My vision unobscuring,
   Could aught have come to pass
   More happiness-insuring
   To her, loved as a lass
   When spouseless, all-alluring?
   I reckon not, alas!

   So, the square window stood,
   Steadily night-long shining
   In my close neighbourhood,
   Who looked forth undivining
   That soon would go for good
   One there in pain reclining,
   Unpardoned, unadieu’d.

   Silently screened from view
   Her tragedy was ending
   That need not have come due
   Had she been less unbending.
   How near, near were we two
   At that last vital rending,—
   And neither of us knew!




TO MY FATHER’S VIOLIN


      DOES he want you down there
      In the Nether Glooms where
   The hours may be a dragging load upon him,
      As he hears the axle grind
         Round and round
      Of the great world, in the blind
         Still profound
   Of the night-time?  He might liven at the sound
   Of your string, revealing you had not forgone him.

      In the gallery west the nave,
      But a few yards from his grave,
   Did you, tucked beneath his chin, to his bowing
      Guide the homely harmony
         Of the quire
      Who for long years strenuously—
         Son and sire—
   Caught the strains that at his fingering low or higher
   From your four thin threads and eff-holes came outflowing.

      And, too, what merry tunes
      He would bow at nights or noons
   That chanced to find him bent to lute a measure,
      When he made you speak his heart
         As in dream,
      Without book or music-chart,
         On some theme
   Elusive as a jack-o’-lanthorn’s gleam,
   And the psalm of duty shelved for trill of pleasure.

      Well, you can not, alas,
      The barrier overpass
   That screens him in those Mournful Meads hereunder,
      Where no fiddling can be heard
         In the glades
      Of silentness, no bird
         Thrills the shades;
   Where no viol is touched for songs or serenades,
   No bowing wakes a congregation’s wonder.

      He must do without you now,
      Stir you no more anyhow
   To yearning concords taught you in your glory;
      While, your strings a tangled wreck,
         Once smart drawn,
      Ten worm-wounds in your neck,
         Purflings wan
   With dust-hoar, here alone I sadly con
   Your present dumbness, shape your olden story.

1916.




THE STATUE OF LIBERTY


      THIS statue of Liberty, busy man,
         Here erect in the city square,
   I have watched while your scrubbings, this early morning,
            Strangely wistful,
            And half tristful,
         Have turned her from foul to fair;

      With your bucket of water, and mop, and brush,
         Bringing her out of the grime
   That has smeared her during the smokes of winter
            With such glumness
            In her dumbness,
         And aged her before her time.

      You have washed her down with motherly care—
         Head, shoulders, arm, and foot,
   To the very hem of the robes that drape her—
            All expertly
            And alertly,
         Till a long stream, black with soot,

      Flows over the pavement to the road,
         And her shape looms pure as snow:
   I read you are hired by the City guardians—
            May be yearly,
            Or once merely—
         To treat the statues so?

      “Oh, I’m not hired by the Councilmen
         To cleanse the statues here.
   I do this one as a self-willed duty,
            Not as paid to,
            Or at all made to,
         But because the doing is dear.”

      Ah, then I hail you brother and friend!
         Liberty’s knight divine.
   What you have done would have been my doing,
            Yea, most verily,
            Well, and thoroughly,
         Had but your courage been mine!

      “Oh I care not for Liberty’s mould,
         Liberty charms not me;
   What’s Freedom but an idler’s vision,
            Vain, pernicious,
            Often vicious,
         Of things that cannot be!

      “Memory it is that brings me to this—
         Of a daughter—my one sweet own.
   She grew a famous carver’s model,
            One of the fairest
            And of the rarest:—
         She sat for the figure as shown.

      “But alas, she died in this distant place
         Before I was warned to betake
   Myself to her side! . . . And in love of my darling,
            In love of the fame of her,
            And the good name of her,
         I do this for her sake.”

      Answer I gave not.  Of that form
         The carver was I at his side;
   His child, my model, held so saintly,
            Grand in feature,
            Gross in nature,
         In the dens of vice had died.




THE BACKGROUND AND THE FIGURE
(_Lover’s Ditty_)


   I think of the slope where the rabbits fed,
      Of the periwinks’ rockwork lair,
   Of the fuchsias ringing their bells of red—
      And the something else seen there.

   Between the blooms where the sod basked bright,
      By the bobbing fuchsia trees,
   Was another and yet more eyesome sight—
      The sight that richened these.

   I shall seek those beauties in the spring,
      When the days are fit and fair,
   But only as foils to the one more thing
      That also will flower there!




THE CHANGE


      OUT of the past there rises a week—
         Who shall read the years O!—
      Out of the past there rises a week
         Enringed with a purple zone.
      Out of the past there rises a week
      When thoughts were strung too thick to speak,
   And the magic of its lineaments remains with me alone.

      In that week there was heard a singing—
         Who shall spell the years, the years!—
      In that week there was heard a singing,
         And the white owl wondered why.
      In that week, yea, a voice was ringing,
      And forth from the casement were candles flinging
   Radiance that fell on the deodar and lit up the path thereby.

      Could that song have a mocking note?—
         Who shall unroll the years O!—
      Could that song have a mocking note
         To the white owl’s sense as it fell?
      Could that song have a mocking note
      As it trilled out warm from the singer’s throat,
   And who was the mocker and who the mocked when two felt all was well?

      In a tedious trampling crowd yet later—
         Who shall bare the years, the years!—
      In a tedious trampling crowd yet later,
         When silvery singings were dumb;
      In a crowd uncaring what time might fate her,
      Mid murks of night I stood to await her,
   And the twanging of iron wheels gave out the signal that she was come.

      She said with a travel-tired smile—
         Who shall lift the years O!—
      She said with a travel-tired smile,
         Half scared by scene so strange;
      She said, outworn by mile on mile,
      The blurred lamps wanning her face the while,
   “O Love, I am here; I am with you!” . . . Ah, that there should have
   come a change!

      O the doom by someone spoken—
         Who shall unseal the years, the years!—
      O the doom that gave no token,
         When nothing of bale saw we:
      O the doom by someone spoken,
      O the heart by someone broken,
   The heart whose sweet reverberances are all time leaves to me.

_Jan.-Feb._ 1913.




SITTING ON THE BRIDGE
(_Echo of an old song_)


      SITTING on the bridge
      Past the barracks, town and ridge,
   At once the spirit seized us
   To sing a song that pleased us—
   As “The Fifth” were much in rumour;
   It was “Whilst I’m in the humour,
      Take me, Paddy, will you now?”
      And a lancer soon drew nigh,
      And his Royal Irish eye
      Said, “Willing, faith, am I,
   O, to take you anyhow, dears,
      To take you anyhow.”

      But, lo!—dad walking by,
      Cried, “What, you lightheels!  Fie!
      Is this the way you roam
      And mock the sunset gleam?”
      And he marched us straightway home,
   Though we said, “We are only, daddy,
   Singing, ‘Will you take me, Paddy?’”
      —Well, we never saw from then
      If we sang there anywhen,
      The soldier dear again,
   Except at night in dream-time,
      Except at night in dream.

   Perhaps that soldier’s fighting
      In a land that’s far away,
   Or he may be idly plighting
      Some foreign hussy gay;
   Or perhaps his bones are whiting
      In the wind to their decay! . . .
      Ah!—does he mind him how
      The girls he saw that day
   On the bridge, were sitting singing
   At the time of curfew-ringing,
   “Take me, Paddy; will you now, dear?
      Paddy, will you now?”

GREY’S BRIDGE.




THE YOUNG CHURCHWARDEN


   WHEN he lit the candles there,
   And the light fell on his hand,
   And it trembled as he scanned
   Her and me, his vanquished air
   Hinted that his dream was done,
   And I saw he had begun
      To understand.

   When Love’s viol was unstrung,
   Sore I wished the hand that shook
   Had been mine that shared her book
   While that evening hymn was sung,
   His the victor’s, as he lit
   Candles where he had bidden us sit
      With vanquished look.

   Now her dust lies listless there,
   His afar from tending hand,
   What avails the victory scanned?
   Does he smile from upper air:
   “Ah, my friend, your dream is done;
   And ’tis _you_ who have begun
      To understand!




“I TRAVEL AS A PHANTOM NOW”


   I TRAVEL as a phantom now,
   For people do not wish to see
   In flesh and blood so bare a bough
      As Nature makes of me.

   And thus I visit bodiless
   Strange gloomy households often at odds,
   And wonder if Man’s consciousness
      Was a mistake of God’s.

   And next I meet you, and I pause,
   And think that if mistake it were,
   As some have said, O then it was
      One that I well can bear!

1915.




LINES
TO A MOVEMENT IN MOZART’S E-FLAT SYMPHONY


         SHOW me again the time
         When in the Junetide’s prime
      We flew by meads and mountains northerly!—
   Yea, to such freshness, fairness, fulness, fineness, freeness,
         Love lures life on.

         Show me again the day
         When from the sandy bay
      We looked together upon the pestered sea!—
   Yea, to such surging, swaying, sighing, swelling, shrinking,
         Love lures life on.

         Show me again the hour
         When by the pinnacled tower
      We eyed each other and feared futurity!—
   Yea, to such bodings, broodings, beatings, blanchings, blessings,
         Love lures life on.

         Show me again just this:
         The moment of that kiss
      Away from the prancing folk, by the strawberry-tree!—
   Yea, to such rashness, ratheness, rareness, ripeness, richness,
         Love lures life on.

“IN THE SEVENTIES”


                 “Qui deridetur ab amico suo sicut ego.”—JOB.

   IN the seventies I was bearing in my breast,
            Penned tight,
   Certain starry thoughts that threw a magic light
   On the worktimes and the soundless hours of rest
   In the seventies; aye, I bore them in my breast
            Penned tight.

   In the seventies when my neighbours—even my friend—
            Saw me pass,
   Heads were shaken, and I heard the words, “Alas,
   For his onward years and name unless he mend!”
   In the seventies, when my neighbours and my friend
         Saw me pass.

   In the seventies those who met me did not know
         Of the vision
   That immuned me from the chillings of mis-prision
   And the damps that choked my goings to and fro
   In the seventies; yea, those nodders did not know
         Of the vision.

   In the seventies nought could darken or destroy it,
         Locked in me,
   Though as delicate as lamp-worm’s lucency;
   Neither mist nor murk could weaken or alloy it
   In the seventies!—could not darken or destroy it,
         Locked in me.




THE PEDIGREE


                                    I

            I BENT in the deep of night
         Over a pedigree the chronicler gave
         As mine; and as I bent there, half-unrobed,
   The uncurtained panes of my window-square let in the watery light
            Of the moon in its old age:
   And green-rheumed clouds were hurrying past where mute and cold it
   globed
      Like a drifting dolphin’s eye seen through a lapping wave.

                                    II

            So, scanning my sire-sown tree,
         And the hieroglyphs of this spouse tied to that,
            With offspring mapped below in lineage,
            Till the tangles troubled me,
   The branches seemed to twist into a seared and cynic face
      Which winked and tokened towards the window like a Mage
         Enchanting me to gaze again thereat.

                                   III

            It was a mirror now,
         And in it a long perspective I could trace
      Of my begetters, dwindling backward each past each
            All with the kindred look,
         Whose names had since been inked down in their place
            On the recorder’s book,
   Generation and generation of my mien, and build, and brow.

                                    IV

            And then did I divine
         That every heave and coil and move I made
         Within my brain, and in my mood and speech,
            Was in the glass portrayed
         As long forestalled by their so making it;
      The first of them, the primest fuglemen of my line,
   Being fogged in far antiqueness past surmise and reason’s reach.

            Said I then, sunk in tone,
      “I am merest mimicker and counterfeit!—
            Though thinking, _I am I_,
      _And what I do I do myself alone_.”
      —The cynic twist of the page thereat unknit
   Back to its normal figure, having wrought its purport wry,
      The Mage’s mirror left the window-square,
   And the stained moon and drift retook their places there.

THIS HEART
A WOMAN’S DREAM


      AT midnight, in the room where he lay dead
      Whom in his life I had never clearly read,
   I thought if I could peer into that citadel
      His heart, I should at last know full and well

      What hereto had been known to him alone,
      Despite our long sit-out of years foreflown,
   “And if,” I said, “I do this for his memory’s sake,
      It would not wound him, even if he could wake.”

      So I bent over him.  He seemed to smile
      With a calm confidence the whole long while
   That I, withdrawing his heart, held it and, bit by bit,
      Perused the unguessed things found written on it.

      It was inscribed like a terrestrial sphere
      With quaint vermiculations close and clear—
   His graving.  Had I known, would I have risked the stroke
      Its reading brought, and my own heart nigh broke!

      Yes, there at last, eyes opened, did I see
      His whole sincere symmetric history;
   There were his truth, his simple singlemindedness,
      Strained, maybe, by time’s storms, but there no less.

      There were the daily deeds from sun to sun
      In blindness, but good faith, that he had done;
   There were regrets, at instances wherein he swerved
      (As he conceived) from cherishings I had deserved.

      There were old hours all figured down as bliss—
      Those spent with me—(how little had I thought this!)
   There those when, at my absence, whether he slept or waked,
      (Though I knew not ’twas so!) his spirit ached.

      There that when we were severed, how day dulled
      Till time joined us anew, was chronicled:
   And arguments and battlings in defence of me
      That heart recorded clearly and ruddily.

      I put it back, and left him as he lay
      While pierced the morning pink and then the gray
   Into each dreary room and corridor around,
      Where I shall wait, but his step will not sound.




WHERE THEY LIVED


      DISHEVELLED leaves creep down
      Upon that bank to-day,
   Some green, some yellow, and some pale brown;
      The wet bents bob and sway;
   The once warm slippery turf is sodden
      Where we laughingly sat or lay.

      The summerhouse is gone,
      Leaving a weedy space;
   The bushes that veiled it once have grown
      Gaunt trees that interlace,
   Through whose lank limbs I see too clearly
      The nakedness of the place.

      And where were hills of blue,
      Blind drifts of vapour blow,
   And the names of former dwellers few,
      If any, people know,
   And instead of a voice that called, “Come in, Dears,”
      Time calls, “Pass below!”




THE OCCULTATION


   WHEN the cloud shut down on the morning shine,
      And darkened the sun,
   I said, “So ended that joy of mine
      Years back begun.”

   But day continued its lustrous roll
      In upper air;
   And did my late irradiate soul
      Live on somewhere?




LIFE LAUGHS ONWARD


   RAMBLING I looked for an old abode
   Where, years back, one had lived I knew;
   Its site a dwelling duly showed,
      But it was new.

   I went where, not so long ago,
   The sod had riven two breasts asunder;
   Daisies throve gaily there, as though
      No grave were under.

   I walked along a terrace where
   Loud children gambolled in the sun;
   The figure that had once sat there
      Was missed by none.

   Life laughed and moved on unsubdued,
   I saw that Old succumbed to Young:
   ’Twas well.  My too regretful mood
      Died on my tongue.




THE PEACE-OFFERING


   IT was but a little thing,
   Yet I knew it meant to me
   Ease from what had given a sting
   To the very birdsinging
      Latterly.

   But I would not welcome it;
   And for all I then declined
   O the regrettings infinite
   When the night-processions flit
      Through the mind!




“SOMETHING TAPPED”


   SOMETHING tapped on the pane of my room
      When there was never a trace
   Of wind or rain, and I saw in the gloom
      My weary Belovéd’s face.

   “O I am tired of waiting,” she said,
      “Night, morn, noon, afternoon;
   So cold it is in my lonely bed,
      And I thought you would join me soon!”

   I rose and neared the window-glass,
      But vanished thence had she:
   Only a pallid moth, alas,
      Tapped at the pane for me.

_August_ 1913.




THE WOUND


   I CLIMBED to the crest,
      And, fog-festooned,
   The sun lay west
      Like a crimson wound:

   Like that wound of mine
      Of which none knew,
   For I’d given no sign
      That it pierced me through.




A MERRYMAKING IN QUESTION


   “I WILL get a new string for my fiddle,
      And call to the neighbours to come,
   And partners shall dance down the middle
      Until the old pewter-wares hum:
      And we’ll sip the mead, cyder, and rum!”

   From the night came the oddest of answers:
      A hollow wind, like a bassoon,
   And headstones all ranged up as dancers,
      And cypresses droning a croon,
      And gurgoyles that mouthed to the tune.




“I SAID AND SANG HER EXCELLENCE”
(_Fickle Lover’s Song_)


   I SAID and sang her excellence:
      They called it laud undue.
         (Have your way, my heart, O!)
   Yet what was homage far above
   The plain deserts of my olden Love
      Proved verity of my new.

   “She moves a sylph in picture-land,
      Where nothing frosts the air:”
         (Have your way, my heart, O!)
   “To all winged pipers overhead
   She is known by shape and song,” I said,
      Conscious of licence there.

   I sang of her in a dim old hall
      Dream-built too fancifully,
         (Have your way, my heart, O!)
   But lo, the ripe months chanced to lead
   My feet to such a hall indeed,
      Where stood the very She.

   Strange, startling, was it then to learn
      I had glanced down unborn time,
         (Have your way, my heart, O!)
   And prophesied, whereby I knew
   That which the years had planned to do
      In warranty of my rhyme.

BY RUSHY-POND.




A JANUARY NIGHT
(1879)


   THE rain smites more and more,
   The east wind snarls and sneezes;
   Through the joints of the quivering door
      The water wheezes.

   The tip of each ivy-shoot
   Writhes on its neighbour’s face;
   There is some hid dread afoot
      That we cannot trace.

   Is it the spirit astray
   Of the man at the house below
   Whose coffin they took in to-day?
      We do not know.




A KISS


   BY a wall the stranger now calls his,
   Was born of old a particular kiss,
   Without forethought in its genesis;
   Which in a trice took wing on the air.
   And where that spot is nothing shows:
      There ivy calmly grows,
      And no one knows
      What a birth was there!

   That kiss is gone where none can tell—
   Not even those who felt its spell:
   It cannot have died; that know we well.
   Somewhere it pursues its flight,
   One of a long procession of sounds
      Travelling aethereal rounds
      Far from earth’s bounds
      In the infinite.




THE ANNOUNCEMENT


   THEY came, the brothers, and took two chairs
      In their usual quiet way;
   And for a time we did not think
         They had much to say.

   And they began and talked awhile
      Of ordinary things,
   Till spread that silence in the room
         A pent thought brings.

   And then they said: “The end has come.
      Yes: it has come at last.”
   And we looked down, and knew that day
         A spirit had passed.




THE OXEN


   CHRISTMAS EVE, and twelve of the clock.
      “Now they are all on their knees,”
   An elder said as we sat in a flock
      By the embers in hearthside ease.

   We pictured the meek mild creatures where
      They dwelt in their strawy pen,
   Nor did it occur to one of us there
      To doubt they were kneeling then.

   So fair a fancy few would weave
      In these years!  Yet, I feel,
   If someone said on Christmas Eve,
      “Come; see the oxen kneel

   “In the lonely barton by yonder coomb
      Our childhood used to know,”
   I should go with him in the gloom,
      Hoping it might be so.

1915.




THE TRESSES


      “WHEN the air was damp
   It made my curls hang slack
   As they kissed my neck and back
   While I footed the salt-aired track
      I loved to tramp.

      “When it was dry
   They would roll up crisp and tight
   As I went on in the light
   Of the sun, which my own sprite
      Seemed to outvie.

      “Now I am old;
   And have not one gay curl
   As I had when a girl
   For dampness to unfurl
      Or sun uphold!”




THE PHOTOGRAPH


   THE flame crept up the portrait line by line
   As it lay on the coals in the silence of night’s profound,
      And over the arm’s incline,
   And along the marge of the silkwork superfine,
   And gnawed at the delicate bosom’s defenceless round.

   Then I vented a cry of hurt, and averted my eyes;
   The spectacle was one that I could not bear,
      To my deep and sad surprise;
   But, compelled to heed, I again looked furtive-wise
   Till the flame had eaten her breasts, and mouth, and hair.

   “Thank God, she is out of it now!” I said at last,
   In a great relief of heart when the thing was done
      That had set my soul aghast,
   And nothing was left of the picture unsheathed from the past
   But the ashen ghost of the card it had figured on.

   She was a woman long hid amid packs of years,
   She might have been living or dead; she was lost to my sight,
      And the deed that had nigh drawn tears
   Was done in a casual clearance of life’s arrears;
   But I felt as if I had put her to death that night! . . .

                                  * * *

   —Well; she knew nothing thereof did she survive,
   And suffered nothing if numbered among the dead;
      Yet—yet—if on earth alive
   Did she feel a smart, and with vague strange anguish strive?
   If in heaven, did she smile at me sadly and shake her head?




ON A HEATH


   I COULD hear a gown-skirt rustling
      Before I could see her shape,
   Rustling through the heather
      That wove the common’s drape,
   On that evening of dark weather
      When I hearkened, lips agape.

   And the town-shine in the distance
      Did but baffle here the sight,
   And then a voice flew forward:
      “Dear, is’t you?  I fear the night!”
   And the herons flapped to norward
      In the firs upon my right.

   There was another looming
      Whose life we did not see;
   There was one stilly blooming
      Full nigh to where walked we;
   There was a shade entombing
      All that was bright of me.




AN ANNIVERSARY


   IT was at the very date to which we have come,
      In the month of the matching name,
   When, at a like minute, the sun had upswum,
      Its couch-time at night being the same.
   And the same path stretched here that people now follow,
      And the same stile crossed their way,
   And beyond the same green hillock and hollow
      The same horizon lay;
   And the same man pilgrims now hereby who pilgrimed here that day.

   Let so much be said of the date-day’s sameness;
      But the tree that neighbours the track,
   And stoops like a pedlar afflicted with lameness,
      Knew of no sogged wound or windcrack.
   And the joints of that wall were not enshrouded
      With mosses of many tones,
   And the garth up afar was not overcrowded
      With a multitude of white stones,
   And the man’s eyes then were not so sunk that you saw the
   socket-bones.

KINGSTON-MAURWARD EWELEASE.




“BY THE RUNIC STONE”
(_Two who became a story_)


         BY the Runic Stone
      They sat, where the grass sloped down,
   And chattered, he white-hatted, she in brown,
         Pink-faced, breeze-blown.

         Rapt there alone
      In the transport of talking so
   In such a place, there was nothing to let them know
         What hours had flown.

         And the die thrown
      By them heedlessly there, the dent
   It was to cut in their encompassment,
         Were, too, unknown.

         It might have strown
      Their zest with qualms to see,
   As in a glass, Time toss their history
         From zone to zone!




THE PINK FROCK


   “O MY pretty pink frock,
   I sha’n’t be able to wear it!
   Why is he dying just now?
      I hardly can bear it!

   “He might have contrived to live on;
   But they say there’s no hope whatever:
   And must I shut myself up,
      And go out never?

   “O my pretty pink frock,
   Puff-sleeved and accordion-pleated!
   He might have passed in July,
      And not so cheated!”




TRANSFORMATIONS


   PORTION of this yew
   Is a man my grandsire knew,
   Bosomed here at its foot:
   This branch may be his wife,
   A ruddy human life
   Now turned to a green shoot.

   These grasses must be made
   Of her who often prayed,
   Last century, for repose;
   And the fair girl long ago
   Whom I often tried to know
   May be entering this rose.

   So, they are not underground,
   But as nerves and veins abound
   In the growths of upper air,
   And they feel the sun and rain,
   And the energy again
   That made them what they were!




IN HER PRECINCTS


   HER house looked cold from the foggy lea,
   And the square of each window a dull black blur
         Where showed no stir:
   Yes, her gloom within at the lack of me
   Seemed matching mine at the lack of her.

   The black squares grew to be squares of light
   As the eyeshade swathed the house and lawn,
         And viols gave tone;
   There was glee within.  And I found that night
   The gloom of severance mine alone.

KINGSTON-MAURWARD PARK.




THE LAST SIGNAL
(_Oct._ 11, 1886)
A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES


      SILENTLY I footed by an uphill road
      That led from my abode to a spot yew-boughed;
   Yellowly the sun sloped low down to westward,
         And dark was the east with cloud.

      Then, amid the shadow of that livid sad east,
      Where the light was least, and a gate stood wide,
   Something flashed the fire of the sun that was facing it,
         Like a brief blaze on that side.

      Looking hard and harder I knew what it meant—
      The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene;
   It meant the west mirrored by the coffin of my friend there,
         Turning to the road from his green,

      To take his last journey forth—he who in his prime
      Trudged so many a time from that gate athwart the land!
   Thus a farewell to me he signalled on his grave-way,
         As with a wave of his hand.

WINTERBORNE-CAME PATH.




THE HOUSE OF SILENCE


      “THAT is a quiet place—
   That house in the trees with the shady lawn.”
   “—If, child, you knew what there goes on
   You would not call it a quiet place.
   Why, a phantom abides there, the last of its race,
      And a brain spins there till dawn.”

      “But I see nobody there,—
   Nobody moves about the green,
   Or wanders the heavy trees between.”
   “—Ah, that’s because you do not bear
   The visioning powers of souls who dare
      To pierce the material screen.

      “Morning, noon, and night,
   Mid those funereal shades that seem
   The uncanny scenery of a dream,
   Figures dance to a mind with sight,
   And music and laughter like floods of light
      Make all the precincts gleam.

      “It is a poet’s bower,
   Through which there pass, in fleet arrays,
   Long teams of all the years and days,
   Of joys and sorrows, of earth and heaven,
   That meet mankind in its ages seven,
      An aion in an hour.”




GREAT THINGS


   SWEET cyder is a great thing,
      A great thing to me,
   Spinning down to Weymouth town
      By Ridgway thirstily,
   And maid and mistress summoning
      Who tend the hostelry:
   O cyder is a great thing,
      A great thing to me!

   The dance it is a great thing,
      A great thing to me,
   With candles lit and partners fit
      For night-long revelry;
   And going home when day-dawning
      Peeps pale upon the lea:
   O dancing is a great thing,
      A great thing to me!

   Love is, yea, a great thing,
      A great thing to me,
   When, having drawn across the lawn
      In darkness silently,
   A figure flits like one a-wing
      Out from the nearest tree:
   O love is, yes, a great thing,
      A great thing to me!

   Will these be always great things,
      Great things to me? . . .
   Let it befall that One will call,
      “Soul, I have need of thee:”
   What then?  Joy-jaunts, impassioned flings,
      Love, and its ecstasy,
   Will always have been great things,
      Great things to me!




THE CHIMES


   THAT morning when I trod the town
   The twitching chimes of long renown
      Played out to me
   The sweet Sicilian sailors’ tune,
   And I knew not if late or soon
      My day would be:

   A day of sunshine beryl-bright
   And windless; yea, think as I might,
      I could not say,
   Even to within years’ measure, when
   One would be at my side who then
      Was far away.

   When hard utilitarian times
   Had stilled the sweet Saint-Peter’s chimes
      I learnt to see
   That bale may spring where blisses are,
   And one desired might be afar
      Though near to me.




THE FIGURE IN THE SCENE


      IT pleased her to step in front and sit
         Where the cragged slope was green,
   While I stood back that I might pencil it
         With her amid the scene;
            Till it gloomed and rained;
   But I kept on, despite the drifting wet
            That fell and stained
   My draught, leaving for curious quizzings yet
            The blots engrained.

      And thus I drew her there alone,
         Seated amid the gauze
   Of moisture, hooded, only her outline shown,
         With rainfall marked across.
            —Soon passed our stay;
   Yet her rainy form is the Genius still of the spot,
            Immutable, yea,
   Though the place now knows her no more, and has known her not
            Ever since that day.

_From an old note_.




“WHY DID I SKETCH”


   WHY did I sketch an upland green,
      And put the figure in
      Of one on the spot with me?—
   For now that one has ceased to be seen
      The picture waxes akin
      To a wordless irony.

   If you go drawing on down or cliff
      Let no soft curves intrude
      Of a woman’s silhouette,
   But show the escarpments stark and stiff
      As in utter solitude;
      So shall you half forget.

   Let me sooner pass from sight of the sky
      Than again on a thoughtless day
      Limn, laugh, and sing, and rhyme
   With a woman sitting near, whom I
      Paint in for love, and who may
      Be called hence in my time!

_From an old note_.




CONJECTURE


   IF there were in my kalendar
      No Emma, Florence, Mary,
   What would be my existence now—
      A hermit’s?—wanderer’s weary?—
         How should I live, and how
         Near would be death, or far?

   Could it have been that other eyes
      Might have uplit my highway?
   That fond, sad, retrospective sight
      Would catch from this dim byway
         Prized figures different quite
         From those that now arise?

   With how strange aspect would there creep
      The dawn, the night, the daytime,
   If memory were not what it is
      In song-time, toil, or pray-time.—
         O were it else than this,
         I’d pass to pulseless sleep!




THE BLOW


   THAT no man schemed it is my hope—
   Yea, that it fell by will and scope
      Of That Which some enthrone,
   And for whose meaning myriads grope.

   For I would not that of my kind
   There should, of his unbiassed mind,
      Have been one known
   Who such a stroke could have designed;

   Since it would augur works and ways
   Below the lowest that man assays
      To have hurled that stone
   Into the sunshine of our days!

   And if it prove that no man did,
   And that the Inscrutable, the Hid,
      Was cause alone
   Of this foul crash our lives amid,

   I’ll go in due time, and forget
   In some deep graveyard’s oubliette
      The thing whereof I groan,
   And cease from troubling; thankful yet

   Time’s finger should have stretched to show
   No aimful author’s was the blow
      That swept us prone,
   But the Immanent Doer’s That doth not know,

   Which in some age unguessed of us
   May lift Its blinding incubus,
      And see, and own:
   “It grieves me I did thus and thus!”




LOVE THE MONOPOLIST
(_Young Lover’s Reverie_)


   THE train draws forth from the station-yard,
      And with it carries me.
   I rise, and stretch out, and regard
      The platform left, and see
   An airy slim blue form there standing,
      And know that it is she.

   While with strained vision I watch on,
      The figure turns round quite
   To greet friends gaily; then is gone . . .
      The import may be slight,
   But why remained she not hard gazing
      Till I was out of sight?

   “O do not chat with others there,”
      I brood.  “They are not I.
   O strain your thoughts as if they were
      Gold bands between us; eye
   All neighbour scenes as so much blankness
      Till I again am by!

   “A troubled soughing in the breeze
      And the sky overhead
   Let yourself feel; and shadeful trees,
      Ripe corn, and apples red,
   Read as things barren and distasteful
      While we are separated!

   “When I come back uncloak your gloom,
      And let in lovely day;
   Then the long dark as of the tomb
      Can well be thrust away
   With sweet things I shall have to practise,
      And you will have to say!”

_Begun_ 1871: _finished_—




AT MIDDLE-FIELD GATE IN FEBRUARY


   THE bars are thick with drops that show
      As they gather themselves from the fog
   Like silver buttons ranged in a row,
   And as evenly spaced as if measured, although
      They fall at the feeblest jog.

   They load the leafless hedge hard by,
      And the blades of last year’s grass,
   While the fallow ploughland turned up nigh
   In raw rolls, clammy and clogging lie—
      Too clogging for feet to pass.

   How dry it was on a far-back day
      When straws hung the hedge and around,
   When amid the sheaves in amorous play
   In curtained bonnets and light array
      Bloomed a bevy now underground!

BOCKHAMPTON LANE.




THE YOUTH WHO CARRIED A LIGHT


   I SAW him pass as the new day dawned,
      Murmuring some musical phrase;
   Horses were drinking and floundering in the pond,
      And the tired stars thinned their gaze;
   Yet these were not the spectacles at all that he conned,
      But an inner one, giving out rays.

   Such was the thing in his eye, walking there,
      The very and visible thing,
   A close light, displacing the gray of the morning air,
      And the tokens that the dark was taking wing;
   And was it not the radiance of a purpose rare
      That might ripe to its accomplishing?

   What became of that light?  I wonder still its fate!
      Was it quenched ere its full apogee?
   Did it struggle frail and frailer to a beam emaciate?
      Did it thrive till matured in verity?
   Or did it travel on, to be a new young dreamer’s freight,
      And thence on infinitely?

1915.




THE HEAD ABOVE THE FOG


      SOMETHING do I see
   Above the fog that sheets the mead,
   A figure like to life indeed,
   Moving along with spectre-speed,
      Seen by none but me.

      O the vision keen!—
   Tripping along to me for love
   As in the flesh it used to move,
   Only its hat and plume above
      The evening fog-fleece seen.

      In the day-fall wan,
   When nighted birds break off their song,
   Mere ghostly head it skims along,
   Just as it did when warm and strong,
      Body seeming gone.

      Such it is I see
   Above the fog that sheets the mead—
   Yea, that which once could breathe and plead!—
   Skimming along with spectre-speed
      To a last tryst with me.




OVERLOOKING THE RIVER STOUR


   THE swallows flew in the curves of an eight
      Above the river-gleam
      In the wet June’s last beam:
   Like little crossbows animate
   The swallows flew in the curves of an eight
      Above the river-gleam.

   Planing up shavings of crystal spray
      A moor-hen darted out
      From the bank thereabout,
   And through the stream-shine ripped his way;
   Planing up shavings of crystal spray
      A moor-hen darted out.

   Closed were the kingcups; and the mead
      Dripped in monotonous green,
      Though the day’s morning sheen
   Had shown it golden and honeybee’d;
   Closed were the kingcups; and the mead
      Dripped in monotonous green.

   And never I turned my head, alack,
      While these things met my gaze
      Through the pane’s drop-drenched glaze,
   To see the more behind my back . . .
   O never I turned, but let, alack,
      These less things hold my gaze!




THE MUSICAL BOX


      LIFELONG to be
   Seemed the fair colour of the time;
   That there was standing shadowed near
   A spirit who sang to the gentle chime
   Of the self-struck notes, I did not hear,
      I did not see.

      Thus did it sing
   To the mindless lyre that played indoors
   As she came to listen for me without:
   “O value what the nonce outpours—
   This best of life—that shines about
      Your welcoming!”

      I had slowed along
   After the torrid hours were done,
   Though still the posts and walls and road
   Flung back their sense of the hot-faced sun,
   And had walked by Stourside Mill, where broad
      Stream-lilies throng.

      And I descried
   The dusky house that stood apart,
   And her, white-muslined, waiting there
   In the porch with high-expectant heart,
   While still the thin mechanic air
      Went on inside.

      At whiles would flit
   Swart bats, whose wings, be-webbed and tanned,
   Whirred like the wheels of ancient clocks:
   She laughed a hailing as she scanned
   Me in the gloom, the tuneful box
      Intoning it.

      Lifelong to be
   I thought it.  That there watched hard by
   A spirit who sang to the indoor tune,
   “O make the most of what is nigh!”
   I did not hear in my dull soul-swoon—
      I did not see.




ON STURMINSTER FOOT-BRIDGE
(ONOMATOPOEIC)


   RETICULATIONS creep upon the slack stream’s face
      When the wind skims irritably past,
   The current clucks smartly into each hollow place
   That years of flood have scrabbled in the pier’s sodden base;
      The floating-lily leaves rot fast.

   On a roof stand the swallows ranged in wistful waiting rows,
      Till they arrow off and drop like stones
   Among the eyot-withies at whose foot the river flows;
   And beneath the roof is she who in the dark world shows
      As a lattice-gleam when midnight moans.




ROYAL SPONSORS


   “THE king and the queen will stand to the child;
      ’Twill be handed down in song;
   And it’s no more than their deserving,
   With my lord so faithful at Court so long,
         And so staunch and strong.

   “O never before was known such a thing!
      ’Twill be a grand time for all;
   And the beef will be a whole-roast bullock,
   And the servants will have a feast in the hall,
         And the ladies a ball.

   “While from Jordan’s stream by a traveller,
      In a flagon of silver wrought,
   And by caravan, stage-coach, wain, and waggon
   A precious trickle has been brought,
         Clear as when caught.”

   The morning came.  To the park of the peer
      The royal couple bore;
   And the font was filled with the Jordan water,
   And the household awaited their guests before
         The carpeted door.

   But when they went to the silk-lined cot
      The child was found to have died.
   “What’s now to be done?  We can disappoint not
   The king and queen!” the family cried
         With eyes spread wide.

   “Even now they approach the chestnut-drive!
      The service must be read.”
   “Well, since we can’t christen the child alive,
   By God we shall have to christen him dead!”
         The marquis said.

   Thus, breath-forsaken, a corpse was taken
      To the private chapel—yea—
   And the king knew not, nor the queen, God wot,
   That they answered for one returned to clay
         At the font that day.




OLD FURNITURE


   I KNOW not how it may be with others
      Who sit amid relics of householdry
   That date from the days of their mothers’ mothers,
      But well I know how it is with me
         Continually.

   I see the hands of the generations
      That owned each shiny familiar thing
   In play on its knobs and indentations,
      And with its ancient fashioning
         Still dallying:

   Hands behind hands, growing paler and paler,
      As in a mirror a candle-flame
   Shows images of itself, each frailer
      As it recedes, though the eye may frame
         Its shape the same.

   On the clock’s dull dial a foggy finger,
      Moving to set the minutes right
   With tentative touches that lift and linger
      In the wont of a moth on a summer night,
         Creeps to my sight.

   On this old viol, too, fingers are dancing—
      As whilom—just over the strings by the nut,
   The tip of a bow receding, advancing
      In airy quivers, as if it would cut
         The plaintive gut.

   And I see a face by that box for tinder,
      Glowing forth in fits from the dark,
   And fading again, as the linten cinder
      Kindles to red at the flinty spark,
         Or goes out stark.

   Well, well.  It is best to be up and doing,
      The world has no use for one to-day
   Who eyes things thus—no aim pursuing!
      He should not continue in this stay,
         But sink away.




A THOUGHT IN TWO MOODS


   I SAW it—pink and white—revealed
      Upon the white and green;
   The white and green was a daisied field,
      The pink and white Ethleen.

   And as I looked it seemed in kind
      That difference they had none;
   The two fair bodiments combined
      As varied miens of one.

   A sense that, in some mouldering year,
      As one they both would lie,
   Made me move quickly on to her
      To pass the pale thought by.

   She laughed and said: “Out there, to me,
      You looked so weather-browned,
   And brown in clothes, you seemed to be
      Made of the dusty ground!”




THE LAST PERFORMANCE


   “I AM playing my oldest tunes,” declared she,
      “All the old tunes I know,—
   Those I learnt ever so long ago.”
   —Why she should think just then she’d play them
      Silence cloaks like snow.

   When I returned from the town at nightfall
      Notes continued to pour
   As when I had left two hours before:
   “It’s the very last time,” she said in closing;
      “From now I play no more.”

   A few morns onward found her fading,
      And, as her life outflew,
   I thought of her playing her tunes right through;
   And I felt she had known of what was coming,
      And wondered how she knew.

1912.




“YOU ON THE TOWER”


                                    I

   “YOU on the tower of my factory—
      What do you see up there?
   Do you see Enjoyment with wide wings
      Advancing to reach me here?”
   —“Yea; I see Enjoyment with wide wings
      Advancing to reach you here.”

                                    II

   “Good.  Soon I’ll come and ask you
      To tell me again thereon . . .
   Well, what is he doing now?  Hoi, there!”
      —“He still is flying on.”
   “Ah, waiting till I have full-finished.
      Good.  Tell me again anon . . .

                                   III

   “Hoi, Watchman!  I’m here.  When comes he?
      Between my sweats I am chill.”
      —“Oh, you there, working still?
   Why, surely he reached you a time back,
      And took you miles from your mill?
   He duly came in his winging,
      And now he has passed out of view.
   How can it be that you missed him?
      He brushed you by as he flew.”




THE INTERLOPER


       “And I saw the figure and visage of Madness seeking for a home.”

   THERE are three folk driving in a quaint old chaise,
   And the cliff-side track looks green and fair;
   I view them talking in quiet glee
   As they drop down towards the puffins’ lair
   By the roughest of ways;
   But another with the three rides on, I see,
      Whom I like not to be there!

   No: it’s not anybody you think of.  Next
   A dwelling appears by a slow sweet stream
   Where two sit happy and half in the dark:
   They read, helped out by a frail-wick’d gleam,
   Some rhythmic text;
   But one sits with them whom they don’t mark,
      One I’m wishing could not be there.

   No: not whom you knew and name.  And now
   I discern gay diners in a mansion-place,
   And the guests dropping wit—pert, prim, or choice,
   And the hostess’s tender and laughing face,
   And the host’s bland brow;
   I cannot help hearing a hollow voice,
      And I’d fain not hear it there.

   No: it’s not from the stranger you met once.  Ah,
   Yet a goodlier scene than that succeeds;
   People on a lawn—quite a crowd of them.  Yes,
   And they chatter and ramble as fancy leads;
   And they say, “Hurrah!”
   To a blithe speech made; save one, mirthless,
      Who ought not to be there.

   Nay: it’s not the pale Form your imagings raise,
   That waits on us all at a destined time,
   It is not the Fourth Figure the Furnace showed,
   O that it were such a shape sublime;
   In these latter days!
   It is that under which best lives corrode;
      Would, would it could not be there!




LOGS ON THE HEARTH
A MEMORY OF A SISTER


      THE fire advances along the log
         Of the tree we felled,
   Which bloomed and bore striped apples by the peck
      Till its last hour of bearing knelled.

      The fork that first my hand would reach
         And then my foot
   In climbings upward inch by inch, lies now
      Sawn, sapless, darkening with soot.

      Where the bark chars is where, one year,
         It was pruned, and bled—
   Then overgrew the wound.  But now, at last,
      Its growings all have stagnated.

      My fellow-climber rises dim
         From her chilly grave—
   Just as she was, her foot near mine on the bending limb,
      Laughing, her young brown hand awave.

_December_ 1915.




THE SUNSHADE


   AH—it’s the skeleton of a lady’s sunshade,
      Here at my feet in the hard rock’s chink,
      Merely a naked sheaf of wires!—
      Twenty years have gone with their livers and diers
      Since it was silked in its white or pink.

   Noonshine riddles the ribs of the sunshade,
      No more a screen from the weakest ray;
      Nothing to tell us the hue of its dyes,
      Nothing but rusty bones as it lies
      In its coffin of stone, unseen till to-day.

   Where is the woman who carried that sun-shade
      Up and down this seaside place?—
      Little thumb standing against its stem,
      Thoughts perhaps bent on a love-stratagem,
      Softening yet more the already soft face!

   Is the fair woman who carried that sunshade
      A skeleton just as her property is,
      Laid in the chink that none may scan?
      And does she regret—if regret dust can—
      The vain things thought when she flourished this?

SWANAGE CLIFFS.




THE AGEING HOUSE


      WHEN the walls were red
      That now are seen
      To be overspread
      With a mouldy green,
      A fresh fair head
      Would often lean
      From the sunny casement
      And scan the scene,
   While blithely spoke the wind to the little sycamore tree.

      But storms have raged
      Those walls about,
      And the head has aged
      That once looked out;
      And zest is suaged
      And trust is doubt,
      And slow effacement
      Is rife throughout,
   While fiercely girds the wind at the long-limbed sycamore tree!




THE CAGED GOLDFINCH


   WITHIN a churchyard, on a recent grave,
      I saw a little cage
   That jailed a goldfinch.  All was silence save
      Its hops from stage to stage.

   There was inquiry in its wistful eye,
      And once it tried to sing;
   Of him or her who placed it there, and why,
      No one knew anything.




AT MADAME TUSSAUD’S IN VICTORIAN YEARS


   “THAT same first fiddler who leads the orchéstra to-night
      Here fiddled four decades of years ago;
   He bears the same babe-like smile of self-centred delight,
   Same trinket on watch-chain, same ring on the hand with the bow.

   “But his face, if regarded, is woefully wanner, and drier,
      And his once dark beard has grown straggling and gray;
   Yet a blissful existence he seems to have led with his lyre,
   In a trance of his own, where no wearing or tearing had sway.

   “Mid these wax figures, who nothing can do, it may seem
      That to do but a little thing counts a great deal;
   To be watched by kings, councillors, queens, may be flattering to him—
   With their glass eyes longing they too could wake notes that appeal.”

                                  * * *

   Ah, but he played staunchly—that fiddler—whoever he was,
      With the innocent heart and the soul-touching string:
   May he find the Fair Haven!  For did he not smile with good cause?
   Yes; gamuts that graced forty years’-flight were not a small thing!




THE BALLET


   THEY crush together—a rustling heap of flesh—
   Of more than flesh, a heap of souls; and then
         They part, enmesh,
      And crush together again,
   Like the pink petals of a too sanguine rose
      Frightened shut just when it blows.

   Though all alike in their tinsel livery,
   And indistinguishable at a sweeping glance,
         They muster, maybe,
      As lives wide in irrelevance;
   A world of her own has each one underneath,
      Detached as a sword from its sheath.

   Daughters, wives, mistresses; honest or false, sold, bought;
   Hearts of all sizes; gay, fond, gushing, or penned,
         Various in thought
         Of lover, rival, friend;
   Links in a one-pulsed chain, all showing one smile,
      Yet severed so many a mile!




THE FIVE STUDENTS


         THE sparrow dips in his wheel-rut bath,
            The sun grows passionate-eyed,
      And boils the dew to smoke by the paddock-path;
            As strenuously we stride,—
   Five of us; dark He, fair He, dark She, fair She, I,
               All beating by.

         The air is shaken, the high-road hot,
            Shadowless swoons the day,
      The greens are sobered and cattle at rest; but not
            We on our urgent way,—
   Four of us; fair She, dark She, fair He, I, are there,
               But one—elsewhere.

         Autumn moulds the hard fruit mellow,
            And forward still we press
      Through moors, briar-meshed plantations, clay-pits yellow,
            As in the spring hours—yes,
   Three of us: fair He, fair She, I, as heretofore,
               But—fallen one more.

         The leaf drops: earthworms draw it in
            At night-time noiselessly,
      The fingers of birch and beech are skeleton-thin,
               And yet on the beat are we,—
   Two of us; fair She, I.  But no more left to go
                  The track we know.

         Icicles tag the church-aisle leads,
            The flag-rope gibbers hoarse,
      The home-bound foot-folk wrap their snow-flaked heads,
               Yet I still stalk the course,—
   One of us . . . Dark and fair He, dark and fair She, gone:
                  The rest—anon.




THE WIND’S PROPHECY


   I TRAVEL on by barren farms,
   And gulls glint out like silver flecks
   Against a cloud that speaks of wrecks,
   And bellies down with black alarms.
   I say: “Thus from my lady’s arms
   I go; those arms I love the best!”
   The wind replies from dip and rise,
   “Nay; toward her arms thou journeyest.”

   A distant verge morosely gray
   Appears, while clots of flying foam
   Break from its muddy monochrome,
   And a light blinks up far away.
   I sigh: “My eyes now as all day
   Behold her ebon loops of hair!”
   Like bursting bonds the wind responds,
   “Nay, wait for tresses flashing fair!”

   From tides the lofty coastlands screen
   Come smitings like the slam of doors,
   Or hammerings on hollow floors,
   As the swell cleaves through caves unseen.
   Say I: “Though broad this wild terrene,
   Her city home is matched of none!”
   From the hoarse skies the wind replies:
   “Thou shouldst have said her sea-bord one.”

   The all-prevailing clouds exclude
   The one quick timorous transient star;
   The waves outside where breakers are
   Huzza like a mad multitude.
   “Where the sun ups it, mist-imbued,”
   I cry, “there reigns the star for me!”
   The wind outshrieks from points and peaks:
   “Here, westward, where it downs, mean ye!”

   Yonder the headland, vulturine,
   Snores like old Skrymer in his sleep,
   And every chasm and every steep
   Blackens as wakes each pharos-shine.
   “I roam, but one is safely mine,”
   I say.  “God grant she stay my own!”
   Low laughs the wind as if it grinned:
   “Thy Love is one thou’st not yet known.”

_Rewritten from an old copy_.




DURING WIND AND RAIN


      THEY sing their dearest songs—
      He, she, all of them—yea,
      Treble and tenor and bass,
         And one to play;
      With the candles mooning each face . . .
         Ah, no; the years O!
   How the sick leaves reel down in throngs!

      They clear the creeping moss—
      Elders and juniors—aye,
      Making the pathways neat
         And the garden gay;
      And they build a shady seat . . .
         Ah, no; the years, the years;
   See, the white storm-birds wing across!

      They are blithely breakfasting all—
      Men and maidens—yea,
      Under the summer tree,
         With a glimpse of the bay,
      While pet fowl come to the knee . . .
         Ah, no; the years O!
   And the rotten rose is ript from the wall.

      They change to a high new house,
      He, she, all of them—aye,
      Clocks and carpets and chairs
         On the lawn all day,
      And brightest things that are theirs . . .
         Ah, no; the years, the years;
   Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs.




HE PREFERS HER EARTHLY


   THIS after-sunset is a sight for seeing,
   Cliff-heads of craggy cloud surrounding it.
      —And dwell you in that glory-show?
   You may; for there are strange strange things in being,
         Stranger than I know.

   Yet if that chasm of splendour claim your presence
   Which glows between the ash cloud and the dun,
      How changed must be your mortal mould!
   Changed to a firmament-riding earthless essence
         From what you were of old:

   All too unlike the fond and fragile creature
   Then known to me . . . Well, shall I say it plain?
      I would not have you thus and there,
   But still would grieve on, missing you, still feature
         You as the one you were.




THE DOLLS


   “WHENEVER you dress me dolls, mammy,
      Why do you dress them so,
   And make them gallant soldiers,
      When never a one I know;
   And not as gentle ladies
      With frills and frocks and curls,
   As people dress the dollies
      Of other little girls?”

   Ah—why did she not answer:—
      “Because your mammy’s heed
   Is always gallant soldiers,
      As well may be, indeed.
   One of them was your daddy,
      His name I must not tell;
   He’s not the dad who lives here,
      But one I love too well.”




MOLLY GONE


      NO more summer for Molly and me;
         There is snow on the tree,
      And the blackbirds plump large as the rooks are, almost,
         And the water is hard
   Where they used to dip bills at the dawn ere her figure was lost
         To these coasts, now my prison close-barred.

      No more planting by Molly and me
         Where the beds used to be
      Of sweet-william; no training the clambering rose
         By the framework of fir
   Now bowering the pathway, whereon it swings gaily and blows
         As if calling commendment from her.

      No more jauntings by Molly and me
         To the town by the sea,
      Or along over Whitesheet to Wynyard’s green Gap,
         Catching Montacute Crest
   To the right against Sedgmoor, and Corton-Hill’s far-distant cap,
         And Pilsdon and Lewsdon to west.

      No more singing by Molly to me
         In the evenings when she
      Was in mood and in voice, and the candles were lit,
         And past the porch-quoin
   The rays would spring out on the laurels; and dumbledores hit
         On the pane, as if wishing to join.

      Where, then, is Molly, who’s no more with me?
         —As I stand on this lea,
      Thinking thus, there’s a many-flamed star in the air,
         That tosses a sign
   That her glance is regarding its face from her home, so that there
         Her eyes may have meetings with mine.




A BACKWARD SPRING


   THE trees are afraid to put forth buds,
   And there is timidity in the grass;
   The plots lie gray where gouged by spuds,
      And whether next week will pass
   Free of sly sour winds is the fret of each bush
      Of barberry waiting to bloom.

   Yet the snowdrop’s face betrays no gloom,
   And the primrose pants in its heedless push,
   Though the myrtle asks if it’s worth the fight
      This year with frost and rime
      To venture one more time
   On delicate leaves and buttons of white
   From the selfsame bough as at last year’s prime,
   And never to ruminate on or remember
   What happened to it in mid-December.

_April_ 1917.




LOOKING ACROSS


                                    I

   IT is dark in the sky,
   And silence is where
   Our laughs rang high;
   And recall do I
   That One is out there.

                                    II

   The dawn is not nigh,
   And the trees are bare,
   And the waterways sigh
   That a year has drawn by,
   And Two are out there.

                                   III

   The wind drops to die
   Like the phantom of Care
   Too frail for a cry,
   And heart brings to eye
   That Three are out there.

                                    IV

   This Life runs dry
   That once ran rare
   And rosy in dye,
   And fleet the days fly,
   And Four are out there.

                                    V

   Tired, tired am I
   Of this earthly air,
   And my wraith asks: Why,
   Since these calm lie,
   Are not Five out there?

_December_ 1915.




AT A SEASIDE TOWN IN 1869
(_Young Lover’s Reverie_)


   I WENT and stood outside myself,
      Spelled the dark sky
      And ship-lights nigh,
   And grumbling winds that passed thereby.

   Then next inside myself I looked,
      And there, above
      All, shone my Love,
   That nothing matched the image of.

   Beyond myself again I ranged;
      And saw the free
      Life by the sea,
   And folk indifferent to me.

   O ’twas a charm to draw within
      Thereafter, where
      But she was; care
   For one thing only, her hid there!

   But so it chanced, without myself
      I had to look,
      And then I took
   More heed of what I had long forsook:

   The boats, the sands, the esplanade,
      The laughing crowd;
      Light-hearted, loud
   Greetings from some not ill-endowed;

   The evening sunlit cliffs, the talk,
      Hailings and halts,
      The keen sea-salts,
   The band, the Morgenblätter Waltz.

   Still, when at night I drew inside
      Forward she came,
      Sad, but the same
   As when I first had known her name.

   Then rose a time when, as by force,
      Outwardly wooed
      By contacts crude,
   Her image in abeyance stood . . .

   At last I said: This outside life
      Shall not endure;
      I’ll seek the pure
   Thought-world, and bask in her allure.

   Myself again I crept within,
      Scanned with keen care
      The temple where
   She’d shone, but could not find her there.

   I sought and sought.  But O her soul
      Has not since thrown
      Upon my own
   One beam!  Yea, she is gone, is gone.

_From an old note_.




THE GLIMPSE


   SHE sped through the door
   And, following in haste,
   And stirred to the core,
   I entered hot-faced;
   But I could not find her,
   No sign was behind her.
   “Where is she?” I said:
   —“Who?” they asked that sat there;
   “Not a soul’s come in sight.”
   —“A maid with red hair.”
   —“Ah.”  They paled.  “She is dead.
   People see her at night,
   But you are the first
   On whom she has burst
   In the keen common light.”

   It was ages ago,
   When I was quite strong:
   I have waited since,—O,
   I have waited so long!
   —Yea, I set me to own
   The house, where now lone
   I dwell in void rooms
   Booming hollow as tombs!
   But I never come near her,
   Though nightly I hear her.
   And my cheek has grown thin
   And my hair has grown gray
   With this waiting therein;
   But she still keeps away!




THE PEDESTRIAN
AN INCIDENT OF 1883


   “SIR, will you let me give you a ride?
   _Nox Venit_, and the heath is wide.”
   —My phaeton-lantern shone on one
      Young, fair, even fresh,
      But burdened with flesh:
   A leathern satchel at his side,
   His breathings short, his coat undone.

   ’Twas as if his corpulent figure slopped
   With the shake of his walking when he stopped,
   And, though the night’s pinch grew acute,
      He wore but a thin
      Wind-thridded suit,
   Yet well-shaped shoes for walking in,
   Artistic beaver, cane gold-topped.

   “Alas, my friend,” he said with a smile,
   “I am daily bound to foot ten mile—
   Wet, dry, or dark—before I rest.
      Six months to live
      My doctors give
   Me as my prospect here, at best,
   Unless I vamp my sturdiest!”

   His voice was that of a man refined,
   A man, one well could feel, of mind,
   Quite winning in its musical ease;
      But in mould maligned
      By some disease;
   And I asked again.  But he shook his head;
   Then, as if more were due, he said:—

   “A student was I—of Schopenhauer,
   Kant, Hegel,—and the fountained bower
   Of the Muses, too, knew my regard:
      But ah—I fear me
      The grave gapes near me! . . .
   Would I could this gross sheath discard,
   And rise an ethereal shape, unmarred!”

   How I remember him!—his short breath,
   His aspect, marked for early death,
   As he dropped into the night for ever;
      One caught in his prime
      Of high endeavour;
   From all philosophies soon to sever
   Through an unconscienced trick of Time!




“WHO’S IN THE NEXT ROOM?”


      “WHO’S in the next room?—who?
         I seemed to see
   Somebody in the dawning passing through,
         Unknown to me.”
   “Nay: you saw nought.  He passed invisibly.”

      “Who’s in the next room?—who?
         I seem to hear
   Somebody muttering firm in a language new
         That chills the ear.”
   “No: you catch not his tongue who has entered there.”

      “Who’s in the next room?—who?
         I seem to feel
   His breath like a clammy draught, as if it drew
         From the Polar Wheel.”
   “No: none who breathes at all does the door conceal.”

      “Who’s in the next room?—who?
         A figure wan
   With a message to one in there of something due?
         Shall I know him anon?”
   “Yea he; and he brought such; and you’ll know him anon.”




AT A COUNTRY FAIR


   At a bygone Western country fair
   I saw a giant led by a dwarf
   With a red string like a long thin scarf;
   How much he was the stronger there
      The giant seemed unaware.

   And then I saw that the giant was blind,
   And the dwarf a shrewd-eyed little thing;
   The giant, mild, timid, obeyed the string
   As if he had no independent mind,
      Or will of any kind.

   Wherever the dwarf decided to go
   At his heels the other trotted meekly,
   (Perhaps—I know not—reproaching weakly)
   Like one Fate bade that it must be so,
      Whether he wished or no.

   Various sights in various climes
   I have seen, and more I may see yet,
   But that sight never shall I forget,
   And have thought it the sorriest of pantomimes,
      If once, a hundred times!




THE MEMORIAL BRASS: 186–


      “WHY do you weep there, O sweet lady,
      Why do you weep before that brass?—
   (I’m a mere student sketching the mediaeval)
      Is some late death lined there, alas?—
   Your father’s? . . . Well, all pay the debt that paid he!”

      “Young man, O must I tell!—My husband’s!  And under
      His name I set mine, and my _death_!—
   Its date left vacant till my heirs should fill it,
      Stating me faithful till my last breath.”
   —“Madam, that you are a widow wakes my wonder!”

      “O wait!  For last month I—remarried!
      And now I fear ’twas a deed amiss.
   We’ve just come home.  And I am sick and saddened
      At what the new one will say to this;
   And will he think—think that I should have tarried?

      “I may add, surely,—with no wish to harm him—
      That he’s a temper—yes, I fear!
   And when he comes to church next Sunday morning,
      And sees that written . . . O dear, O dear!”
   —“Madam, I swear your beauty will disarm him!”




HER LOVE-BIRDS


   WHEN I looked up at my love-birds
      That Sunday afternoon,
      There was in their tiny tune
   A dying fetch like broken words,
   When I looked up at my love-birds
      That Sunday afternoon.

   When he, too, scanned the love-birds
      On entering there that day,
      ’Twas as if he had nought to say
   Of his long journey citywards,
   When he, too, scanned the love-birds,
      On entering there that day.

   And billed and billed the love-birds,
      As ’twere in fond despair
      At the stress of silence where
   Had once been tones in tenor thirds,
   And billed and billed the love-birds
      As ’twere in fond despair.

   O, his speech that chilled the love-birds,
      And smote like death on me,
      As I learnt what was to be,
   And knew my life was broke in sherds!
   O, his speech that chilled the love-birds,
      And smote like death on me!




PAYING CALLS


   I WENT by footpath and by stile
      Beyond where bustle ends,
   Strayed here a mile and there a mile
      And called upon some friends.

   On certain ones I had not seen
      For years past did I call,
   And then on others who had been
      The oldest friends of all.

   It was the time of midsummer
      When they had used to roam;
   But now, though tempting was the air,
      I found them all at home.

   I spoke to one and other of them
      By mound and stone and tree
   Of things we had done ere days were dim,
      But they spoke not to me.




THE UPPER BIRCH-LEAVES


   Warm yellowy-green
   In the blue serene,
   How they skip and sway
   On this autumn day!
   They cannot know
   What has happened below,—
   That their boughs down there
   Are already quite bare,
   That their own will be
   When a week has passed,—
   For they jig as in glee
   To this very last.

   But no; there lies
   At times in their tune
   A note that cries
   What at first I fear
   I did not hear:
   “O we remember
   At each wind’s hollo—
   Though life holds yet—
   We go hence soon,
   For ’tis November;
   —But that you follow
   You may forget!”




“IT NEVER LOOKS LIKE SUMMER”


   “IT never looks like summer here
      On Beeny by the sea.”
   But though she saw its look as drear,
      Summer it seemed to me.

   It never looks like summer now
      Whatever weather’s there;
   But ah, it cannot anyhow,
      On Beeny or elsewhere!

   BOSCASTLE,
_March_ 8, 1913.




EVERYTHING COMES


   “THE house is bleak and cold
      Built so new for me!
   All the winds upon the wold
      Search it through for me;
   No screening trees abound,
   And the curious eyes around
      Keep on view for me.”

   “My Love, I am planting trees
      As a screen for you
   Both from winds, and eyes that tease
      And peer in for you.
   Only wait till they have grown,
   No such bower will be known
      As I mean for you.”

   “Then I will bear it, Love,
      And will wait,” she said.
   —So, with years, there grew a grove.
      “Skill how great!” she said.
   “As you wished, Dear?”—“Yes, I see!
   But—I’m dying; and for me
      ’Tis too late,” she said.




THE MAN WITH A PAST


      THERE was merry-making
      When the first dart fell
      As a heralding,—
   Till grinned the fully bared thing,
      And froze like a spell—
         Like a spell.

      Innocent was she,
      Innocent was I,
      Too simple we!
   Before us we did not see,
      Nearing, aught wry—
         Aught wry!

      I can tell it not now,
      It was long ago;
      And such things cow;
   But that is why and how
      Two lives were so—
         Were so.

      Yes, the years matured,
      And the blows were three
      That time ensured
   On her, which she dumbly endured;
      And one on me—
         One on me.




HE FEARS HIS GOOD FORTUNE


   THERE was a glorious time
   At an epoch of my prime;
   Mornings beryl-bespread,
   And evenings golden-red;
      Nothing gray:
   And in my heart I said,
   “However this chanced to be,
   It is too full for me,
   Too rare, too rapturous, rash,
   Its spell must close with a crash
      Some day!”

   The radiance went on
   Anon and yet anon,
   And sweetness fell around
   Like manna on the ground.
      “I’ve no claim,”
   Said I, “to be thus crowned:
   I am not worthy this:—
   Must it not go amiss?—
   Well . . . let the end foreseen
   Come duly!—I am serene.”
      —And it came.




HE WONDERS ABOUT HIMSELF


   NO use hoping, or feeling vext,
   Tugged by a force above or under
   Like some fantocine, much I wonder
   What I shall find me doing next!

   Shall I be rushing where bright eyes be?
   Shall I be suffering sorrows seven?
   Shall I be watching the stars of heaven,
   Thinking one of them looks like thee?

   Part is mine of the general Will,
   Cannot my share in the sum of sources
   Bend a digit the poise of forces,
   And a fair desire fulfil?

_Nov._ 1893.




JUBILATE


   “THE very last time I ever was here,” he said,
   “I saw much less of the quick than I saw of the dead.”
   —He was a man I had met with somewhere before,
   But how or when I now could recall no more.

   “The hazy mazy moonlight at one in the morning
   Spread out as a sea across the frozen snow,
   Glazed to live sparkles like the great breastplate adorning
   The priest of the Temple, with Urim and Thummim aglow.

   “The yew-tree arms, glued hard to the stiff stark air,
   Hung still in the village sky as theatre-scenes
   When I came by the churchyard wall, and halted there
   At a shut-in sound of fiddles and tambourines.

   “And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, haut-boys, and shawms,
   And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass,
   Joined in, and were intermixed with a singing of psalms;
   And I looked over at the dead men’s dwelling-place.

   “Through the shine of the slippery snow I now could see,
   As it were through a crystal roof, a great company
   Of the dead minueting in stately step underground
   To the tune of the instruments I had before heard sound.

   “It was ‘Eden New,’ and dancing they sang in a chore,
   ‘We are out of it all!—yea, in Little-Ease cramped no more!’
   And their shrouded figures pacing with joy I could see
   As you see the stage from the gallery.  And they had no heed of me.

   “And I lifted my head quite dazed from the churchyard wall
   And I doubted not that it warned I should soon have my call.
   But—” . . . Then in the ashes he emptied the dregs of his cup,
   And onward he went, and the darkness swallowed him up.




HE REVISITS HIS FIRST SCHOOL


   I SHOULD not have shown in the flesh,
   I ought to have gone as a ghost;
   It was awkward, unseemly almost,
   Standing solidly there as when fresh,
      Pink, tiny, crisp-curled,
      My pinions yet furled
      From the winds of the world.

   After waiting so many a year
   To wait longer, and go as a sprite
   From the tomb at the mid of some night
   Was the right, radiant way to appear;
      Not as one wanzing weak
      From life’s roar and reek,
      His rest still to seek:

   Yea, beglimpsed through the quaint quarried glass
   Of green moonlight, by me greener made,
   When they’d cry, perhaps, “There sits his shade
   In his olden haunt—just as he was
      When in Walkingame he
      Conned the grand Rule-of-Three
      With the bent of a bee.”

   But to show in the afternoon sun,
   With an aspect of hollow-eyed care,
   When none wished to see me come there,
   Was a garish thing, better undone.
      Yes; wrong was the way;
      But yet, let me say,
      I may right it—some day.




“I THOUGHT, MY HEART”


   I THOUGHT, my Heart, that you had healed
   Of those sore smartings of the past,
   And that the summers had oversealed
      All mark of them at last.
   But closely scanning in the night
   I saw them standing crimson-bright
         Just as she made them:
         Nothing could fade them;
         Yea, I can swear
         That there they were—
         They still were there!

   Then the Vision of her who cut them came,
   And looking over my shoulder said,
   “I am sure you deal me all the blame
      For those sharp smarts and red;
   But meet me, dearest, to-morrow night,
   In the churchyard at the moon’s half-height,
         And so strange a kiss
         Shall be mine, I wis,
         That you’ll cease to know
         If the wounds you show
         Be there or no!”




FRAGMENT


   AT last I entered a long dark gallery,
      Catacomb-lined; and ranged at the side
      Were the bodies of men from far and wide
   Who, motion past, were nevertheless not dead.

   “The sense of waiting here strikes strong;
      Everyone’s waiting, waiting, it seems to me;
      What are you waiting for so long?—
   What is to happen?” I said.

   “O we are waiting for one called God,” said they,
      “(Though by some the Will, or Force, or Laws;
      And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate Cause;)
   Waiting for him to see us before we are clay.
   Yes; waiting, waiting, for God _to know it_” . . .

      “To know what?” questioned I.
   “To know how things have been going on earth and below it:
      It is clear he must know some day.”
      I thereon asked them why.

   “Since he made us humble pioneers
   Of himself in consciousness of Life’s tears,
   It needs no mighty prophecy
   To tell that what he could mindlessly show
   His creatures, he himself will know.

   “By some still close-cowled mystery
   We have reached feeling faster than he,
   But he will overtake us anon,
      If the world goes on.”




MIDNIGHT ON THE GREAT WESTERN


   In the third-class seat sat the journeying boy,
      And the roof-lamp’s oily flame
   Played down on his listless form and face,
   Bewrapt past knowing to what he was going,
         Or whence he came.

   In the band of his hat the journeying boy
      Had a ticket stuck; and a string
   Around his neck bore the key of his box,
   That twinkled gleams of the lamp’s sad beams
         Like a living thing.

   What past can be yours, O journeying boy
      Towards a world unknown,
   Who calmly, as if incurious quite
   On all at stake, can undertake
         This plunge alone?

   Knows your soul a sphere, O journeying boy,
      Our rude realms far above,
   Whence with spacious vision you mark and mete
   This region of sin that you find you in,
         But are not of?




HONEYMOON TIME AT AN INN


   AT the shiver of morning, a little before the false dawn,
         The moon was at the window-square,
      Deedily brooding in deformed decay—
      The curve hewn off her cheek as by an adze;
   At the shiver of morning a little before the false dawn
      So the moon looked in there.

   Her speechless eyeing reached across the chamber,
         Where lay two souls opprest,
      One a white lady sighing, “Why am I sad!”
      To him who sighed back, “Sad, my Love, am I!”
   And speechlessly the old moon conned the chamber,
      And these two reft of rest.

   While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there,
         Nought seeming imminent,
      Something fell sheer, and crashed, and from the floor
      Lay glittering at the pair with a shattered gaze,
   While their large-pupilled vision swept the scene there,
      And the many-eyed thing outleant.

   With a start they saw that it was an old-time pier-glass
         Which had stood on the mantel near,
      Its silvering blemished,—yes, as if worn away
      By the eyes of the countless dead who had smirked at it
   Ere these two ever knew that old-time pier-glass
      And its vague and vacant leer.

   As he looked, his bride like a moth skimmed forth, and kneeling
         Quick, with quivering sighs,
      Gathered the pieces under the moon’s sly ray,
      Unwitting as an automaton what she did;
   Till he entreated, hasting to where she was kneeling,
      “Let it stay where it lies!”

   “Long years of sorrow this means!” breathed the lady
         As they retired.  “Alas!”
      And she lifted one pale hand across her eyes.
      “Don’t trouble, Love; it’s nothing,” the bridegroom said.
   “Long years of sorrow for us!” murmured the lady,
      “Or ever this evil pass!”

   And the Spirits Ironic laughed behind the wainscot,
         And the Spirits of Pity sighed.
      “It’s good,” said the Spirits Ironic, “to tickle their minds
      With a portent of their wedlock’s after-grinds.”
   And the Spirits of Pity sighed behind the wainscot,
      “It’s a portent we cannot abide!

   “More, what shall happen to prove the truth of the portent?”
         —“Oh; in brief, they will fade till old,
      And their loves grow numbed ere death, by the cark of care.”
   —“But nought see we that asks for portents there?—
   ’Tis the lot of all.”—“Well, no less true is a portent
      That it fits all mortal mould.”




THE ROBIN


   WHEN up aloft
   I fly and fly,
   I see in pools
   The shining sky,
   And a happy bird
   Am I, am I!

   When I descend
   Towards their brink
   I stand, and look,
   And stoop, and drink,
   And bathe my wings,
   And chink and prink.

   When winter frost
   Makes earth as steel
   I search and search
   But find no meal,
   And most unhappy
   Then I feel.

   But when it lasts,
   And snows still fall,
   I get to feel
   No grief at all,
   For I turn to a cold stiff
   Feathery ball!




“I ROSE AND WENT TO ROU’TOR TOWN”
(_She_, _alone_)


   I ROSE and went to Rou’tor Town
      With gaiety and good heart,
      And ardour for the start,
   That morning ere the moon was down
   That lit me off to Rou’tor Town
      With gaiety and good heart.

   When sojourn soon at Rou’tor Town
      Wrote sorrows on my face,
      I strove that none should trace
   The pale and gray, once pink and brown,
   When sojourn soon at Rou’tor Town
      Wrote sorrows on my face.

   The evil wrought at Rou’tor Town
      On him I’d loved so true
      I cannot tell anew:
   But nought can quench, but nought can drown
   The evil wrought at Rou’tor Town
      On him I’d loved so true!




THE NETTLES


      THIS, then, is the grave of my son,
      Whose heart she won!  And nettles grow
   Upon his mound; and she lives just below.

      How he upbraided me, and left,
      And our lives were cleft, because I said
   She was hard, unfeeling, caring but to wed.

      Well, to see this sight I have fared these miles,
      And her firelight smiles from her window there,
   Whom he left his mother to cherish with tender care!

      It is enough.  I’ll turn and go;
      Yes, nettles grow where lone lies he,
   Who spurned me for seeing what he could not see.




IN A WAITING-ROOM


   ON a morning sick as the day of doom
      With the drizzling gray
      Of an English May,
   There were few in the railway waiting-room.
   About its walls were framed and varnished
   Pictures of liners, fly-blown, tarnished.
   The table bore a Testament
   For travellers’ reading, if suchwise bent.

         I read it on and on,
      And, thronging the Gospel of Saint John,
      Were figures—additions, multiplications—
   By some one scrawled, with sundry emendations;
         Not scoffingly designed,
         But with an absent mind,—
      Plainly a bagman’s counts of cost,
      What he had profited, what lost;
   And whilst I wondered if there could have been
         Any particle of a soul
         In that poor man at all,

      To cypher rates of wage
      Upon that printed page,
      There joined in the charmless scene
   And stood over me and the scribbled book
      (To lend the hour’s mean hue
      A smear of tragedy too)
   A soldier and wife, with haggard look
   Subdued to stone by strong endeavour;
      And then I heard
      From a casual word
   They were parting as they believed for ever.

      But next there came
      Like the eastern flame
   Of some high altar, children—a pair—
   Who laughed at the fly-blown pictures there.
   “Here are the lovely ships that we,
   Mother, are by and by going to see!
   When we get there it’s ’most sure to be fine,
   And the band will play, and the sun will shine!”

   It rained on the skylight with a din
   As we waited and still no train came in;
   But the words of the child in the squalid room
   Had spread a glory through the gloom.




THE CLOCK-WINDER


   IT is dark as a cave,
   Or a vault in the nave
   When the iron door
   Is closed, and the floor
   Of the church relaid
   With trowel and spade.

   But the parish-clerk
   Cares not for the dark
   As he winds in the tower
   At a regular hour
   The rheumatic clock,
   Whose dilatory knock
   You can hear when praying
   At the day’s decaying,
   Or at any lone while
   From a pew in the aisle.

   Up, up from the ground
   Around and around
   In the turret stair
   He clambers, to where
   The wheelwork is,
   With its tick, click, whizz,
   Reposefully measuring
   Each day to its end
   That mortal men spend
   In sorrowing and pleasuring
   Nightly thus does he climb
   To the trackway of Time.

   Him I followed one night
   To this place without light,
   And, ere I spoke, heard
   Him say, word by word,
   At the end of his winding,
   The darkness unminding:—

   “So I wipe out one more,
   My Dear, of the sore
   Sad days that still be,
   Like a drying Dead Sea,
   Between you and me!”

   Who she was no man knew:
   He had long borne him blind
   To all womankind;
   And was ever one who
   Kept his past out of view.




OLD EXCURSIONS


   “WHAT’S the good of going to Ridgeway,
      Cerne, or Sydling Mill,
      Or to Yell’ham Hill,
   Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way
      As we used to do?
   She will no more climb up there,
   Or be visible anywhere
      In those haunts we knew.”

   But to-night, while walking weary,
      Near me seemed her shade,
      Come as ’twere to upbraid
   This my mood in deeming dreary
      Scenes that used to please;
   And, if she did come to me,
   Still solicitous, there may be
      Good in going to these.

   So, I’ll care to roam to Ridgeway,
      Cerne, or Sydling Mill,
      Or to Yell’ham Hill,
   Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way
      As we used to do,
   Since her phasm may flit out there,
   And may greet me anywhere
      In those haunts we knew.

_April_ 1913.




THE MASKED FACE


   I FOUND me in a great surging space,
      At either end a door,
   And I said: “What is this giddying place,
      With no firm-fixéd floor,
      That I knew not of before?”
      “It is Life,” said a mask-clad face.

   I asked: “But how do I come here,
      Who never wished to come;
   Can the light and air be made more clear,
      The floor more quietsome,
      And the doors set wide?  They numb
      Fast-locked, and fill with fear.”

   The mask put on a bleak smile then,
      And said, “O vassal-wight,
   There once complained a goosequill pen
      To the scribe of the Infinite
      Of the words it had to write
      Because they were past its ken.”




IN A WHISPERING GALLERY


   THAT whisper takes the voice
   Of a Spirit’s compassionings
   Close, but invisible,
   And throws me under a spell
   At the kindling vision it brings;
   And for a moment I rejoice,
   And believe in transcendent things
   That would mould from this muddy earth
   A spot for the splendid birth
   Of everlasting lives,
   Whereto no night arrives;
   And this gaunt gray gallery
   A tabernacle of worth
   On this drab-aired afternoon,
   When you can barely see
   Across its hazed lacune
   If opposite aught there be
   Of fleshed humanity
   Wherewith I may commune;
   Or if the voice so near
   Be a soul’s voice floating here.




THE SOMETHING THAT SAVED HIM


      IT was when
   Whirls of thick waters laved me
      Again and again,
   That something arose and saved me;
      Yea, it was then.

      In that day
   Unseeing the azure went I
      On my way,
   And to white winter bent I,
      Knowing no May.

      Reft of renown,
   Under the night clouds beating
      Up and down,
   In my needfulness greeting
      Cit and clown.

      Long there had been
   Much of a murky colour
      In the scene,
   Dull prospects meeting duller;
      Nought between.

      Last, there loomed
   A closing-in blind alley,
      Though there boomed
   A feeble summons to rally
      Where it gloomed.

      The clock rang;
   The hour brought a hand to deliver;
      I upsprang,
   And looked back at den, ditch and river,
      And sang.




THE ENEMY’S PORTRAIT


   HE saw the portrait of his enemy, offered
   At auction in a street he journeyed nigh,
   That enemy, now late dead, who in his life-time
   Had injured deeply him the passer-by.
   “To get that picture, pleased be God, I’ll try,
   And utterly destroy it; and no more
   Shall be inflicted on man’s mortal eye
   A countenance so sinister and sore!”

   And so he bought the painting.  Driving homeward,
   “The frame will come in useful,” he declared,
   “The rest is fuel.”  On his arrival, weary,
   Asked what he bore with him, and how he fared,
   He said he had bid for a picture, though he cared
   For the frame only: on the morrow he
   Would burn the canvas, which could well be spared,
   Seeing that it portrayed his enemy.

   Next day some other duty found him busy;
   The foe was laid his face against the wall;
   But on the next he set himself to loosen
   The straining-strips.  And then a casual call
   Prevented his proceeding therewithal;
   And thus the picture waited, day by day,
   Its owner’s pleasure, like a wretched thrall,
   Until a month and more had slipped away.

   And then upon a morn he found it shifted,
   Hung in a corner by a servitor.
   “Why did you take on you to hang that picture?
   You know it was the frame I bought it for.”
   “It stood in the way of every visitor,
   And I just hitched it there.”—“Well, it must go:
   I don’t commemorate men whom I abhor.
   Remind me ’tis to do.  The frame I’ll stow.”

   But things become forgotten.  In the shadow
   Of the dark corner hung it by its string,
   And there it stayed—once noticed by its owner,
   Who said, “Ah me—I must destroy that thing!”
   But when he died, there, none remembering,
   It hung, till moved to prominence, as one sees;
   And comers pause and say, examining,
   “I thought they were the bitterest enemies?”




IMAGININGS


      SHE saw herself a lady
         With fifty frocks in wear,
   And rolling wheels, and rooms the best,
         And faithful maidens’ care,
      And open lawns and shady
         For weathers warm or drear.

      She found herself a striver,
         All liberal gifts debarred,
   With days of gloom, and movements stressed,
         And early visions marred,
      And got no man to wive her
         But one whose lot was hard.

      Yet in the moony night-time
         She steals to stile and lea
   During his heavy slumberous rest
         When homecome wearily,
      And dreams of some blest bright-time
         She knows can never be.




ON THE DOORSTEP


   THE rain imprinted the step’s wet shine
   With target-circles that quivered and crossed
   As I was leaving this porch of mine;
   When from within there swelled and paused
         A song’s sweet note;
      And back I turned, and thought,
         “Here I’ll abide.”

   The step shines wet beneath the rain,
   Which prints its circles as heretofore;
   I watch them from the porch again,
   But no song-notes within the door
         Now call to me
      To shun the dripping lea
         And forth I stride.

_Jan._ 1914.




SIGNS AND TOKENS


   SAID the red-cloaked crone
   In a whispered moan:

   “The dead man was limp
   When laid in his chest;
   Yea, limp; and why
   But to signify
   That the grave will crimp
   Ere next year’s sun
   Yet another one
   Of those in that house—
   It may be the best—
   For its endless drowse!”

   Said the brown-shawled dame
   To confirm the same:

   “And the slothful flies
   On the rotting fruit
   Have been seen to wear
   While crawling there
   Crape scarves, by eyes
   That were quick and acute;
   As did those that had pitched
   On the cows by the pails,
   And with flaps of their tails
   Were far away switched.”

   Said the third in plaid,
   Each word being weighed:

   “And trotting does
   In the park, in the lane,
   And just outside
   The shuttered pane,
   Have also been heard—
   Quick feet as light
   As the feet of a sprite—
   And the wise mind knows
   What things may betide
   When such has occurred.”

   Cried the black-craped fourth,
   Cold faced as the north:

   “O, though giving such
   Some head-room, I smile
   At your falterings
   When noting those things
   Round your domicile!
   For what, what can touch
   One whom, riven of all
   That makes life gay,
   No hints can appal
   Of more takings away!”




PATHS OF FORMER TIME


         NO; no;
      It must not be so:
   They are the ways we do not go.

         Still chew
      The kine, and moo
   In the meadows we used to wander through;

         Still purl
      The rivulets and curl
   Towards the weirs with a musical swirl;

         Haymakers
      As in former years
   Rake rolls into heaps that the pitchfork rears;

         Wheels crack
      On the turfy track
   The waggon pursues with its toppling pack.

         “Why then shun—
      Since summer’s not done—
   All this because of the lack of one?”

         Had you been
      Sharer of that scene
   You would not ask while it bites in keen

         Why it is so
      We can no more go
   By the summer paths we used to know!

1913.




THE CLOCK OF THE YEARS


      “A spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.”

      AND the Spirit said,
   “I can make the clock of the years go backward,
   But am loth to stop it where you will.”
      And I cried, “Agreed
      To that.  Proceed:
      It’s better than dead!”

      He answered, “Peace”;
   And called her up—as last before me;
   Then younger, younger she freshed, to the year
      I first had known
      Her woman-grown,
      And I cried, “Cease!—

      “Thus far is good—
   It is enough—let her stay thus always!”
   But alas for me.  He shook his head:
      No stop was there;
      And she waned child-fair,
      And to babyhood.

      Still less in mien
   To my great sorrow became she slowly,
   And smalled till she was nought at all
      In his checkless griff;
      And it was as if
      She had never been.

      “Better,” I plained,
   “She were dead as before!  The memory of her
   Had lived in me; but it cannot now!”
      And coldly his voice:
      “It was your choice
      To mar the ordained.”

1916.




AT THE PIANO


   A WOMAN was playing,
      A man looking on;
      And the mould of her face,
      And her neck, and her hair,
      Which the rays fell upon
      Of the two candles there,
   Sent him mentally straying
      In some fancy-place
      Where pain had no trace.

   A cowled Apparition
      Came pushing between;
      And her notes seemed to sigh,
      And the lights to burn pale,
      As a spell numbed the scene.
      But the maid saw no bale,
   And the man no monition;
      And Time laughed awry,
      And the Phantom hid nigh.




THE SHADOW ON THE STONE


         I WENT by the Druid stone
      That broods in the garden white and lone,
   And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows
      That at some moments fall thereon
      From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,
      And they shaped in my imagining
   To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders
      Threw there when she was gardening.

         I thought her behind my back,
      Yea, her I long had learned to lack,
   And I said: “I am sure you are standing behind me,
      Though how do you get into this old track?”
      And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf
      As a sad response; and to keep down grief
   I would not turn my head to discover
      That there was nothing in my belief.

         Yet I wanted to look and see
      That nobody stood at the back of me;
   But I thought once more: “Nay, I’ll not unvision
      A shape which, somehow, there may be.”
      So I went on softly from the glade,
      And left her behind me throwing her shade,
   As she were indeed an apparition—
      My head unturned lest my dream should fade.

_Begun_ 1913: _finished_ 1916.




IN THE GARDEN
(M. H.)


   WE waited for the sun
   To break its cloudy prison
   (For day was not yet done,
   And night still unbegun)
   Leaning by the dial.

   After many a trial—
   We all silent there—
   It burst as new-arisen,
   Throwing a shade to where
   Time travelled at that minute.

   Little saw we in it,
   But this much I know,
   Of lookers on that shade,
   Her towards whom it made
   Soonest had to go.

1915.




THE TREE AND THE LADY


         I HAVE done all I could
   For that lady I knew!  Through the heats I have shaded her,
   Drawn to her songsters when summer has jaded her,
      Home from the heath or the wood.

         At the mirth-time of May,
   When my shadow first lured her, I’d donned my new bravery
   Of greenth: ’twas my all.  Now I shiver in slavery,
      Icicles grieving me gray.

         Plumed to every twig’s end
   I could tempt her chair under me.  Much did I treasure her
   During those days she had nothing to pleasure her;
      Mutely she used me as friend.

         I’m a skeleton now,
   And she’s gone, craving warmth.  The rime sticks like a skin to me;
   Through me Arcturus peers; Nor’lights shoot into me;
      Gone is she, scorning my bough!




AN UPBRAIDING


   NOW I am dead you sing to me
      The songs we used to know,
   But while I lived you had no wish
      Or care for doing so.

   Now I am dead you come to me
      In the moonlight, comfortless;
   Ah, what would I have given alive
      To win such tenderness!

   When you are dead, and stand to me
      Not differenced, as now,
   But like again, will you be cold
      As when we lived, or how?




THE YOUNG GLASS-STAINER


   “THESE Gothic windows, how they wear me out
   With cusp and foil, and nothing straight or square,
   Crude colours, leaden borders roundabout,
   And fitting in Peter here, and Matthew there!

   “What a vocation!  Here do I draw now
   The abnormal, loving the Hellenic norm;
   Martha I paint, and dream of Hera’s brow,
   Mary, and think of Aphrodite’s form.”

_Nov._ 1893.




LOOKING AT A PICTURE ON AN ANNIVERSARY


   BUT don’t you know it, my dear,
      Don’t you know it,
   That this day of the year
   (What rainbow-rays embow it!)
   We met, strangers confessed,
      But parted—blest?

   Though at this query, my dear,
      There in your frame
   Unmoved you still appear,
   You must be thinking the same,
   But keep that look demure
      Just to allure.

   And now at length a trace
      I surely vision
   Upon that wistful face
   Of old-time recognition,
   Smiling forth, “Yes, as you say,
      It is the day.”

   For this one phase of you
      Now left on earth
   This great date must endue
   With pulsings of rebirth?—
   I see them vitalize
      Those two deep eyes!

   But if this face I con
      Does not declare
   Consciousness living on
   Still in it, little I care
   To live myself, my dear,
      Lone-labouring here!

_Spring_ 1913.




THE CHOIRMASTER’S BURIAL


   HE often would ask us
   That, when he died,
   After playing so many
   To their last rest,
   If out of us any
   Should here abide,
   And it would not task us,
   We would with our lutes
   Play over him
   By his grave-brim
   The psalm he liked best—
   The one whose sense suits
   “Mount Ephraim”—
   And perhaps we should seem
   To him, in Death’s dream,
   Like the seraphim.

   As soon as I knew
   That his spirit was gone
   I thought this his due,
   And spoke thereupon.
   “I think,” said the vicar,
   “A read service quicker
   Than viols out-of-doors
   In these frosts and hoars.
   That old-fashioned way
   Requires a fine day,
   And it seems to me
   It had better not be.”

   Hence, that afternoon,
   Though never knew he
   That his wish could not be,
   To get through it faster
   They buried the master
   Without any tune.

   But ’twas said that, when
   At the dead of next night
   The vicar looked out,
   There struck on his ken
   Thronged roundabout,
   Where the frost was graying
   The headstoned grass,
   A band all in white
   Like the saints in church-glass,
   Singing and playing
   The ancient stave
   By the choirmaster’s grave.

   Such the tenor man told
   When he had grown old.




THE MAN WHO FORGOT


   AT a lonely cross where bye-roads met
      I sat upon a gate;
   I saw the sun decline and set,
      And still was fain to wait.

   A trotting boy passed up the way
      And roused me from my thought;
   I called to him, and showed where lay
      A spot I shyly sought.

   “A summer-house fair stands hidden where
      You see the moonlight thrown;
   Go, tell me if within it there
      A lady sits alone.”

   He half demurred, but took the track,
      And silence held the scene;
   I saw his figure rambling back;
      I asked him if he had been.

   “I went just where you said, but found
      No summer-house was there:
   Beyond the slope ’tis all bare ground;
      Nothing stands anywhere.

   “A man asked what my brains were worth;
      The house, he said, grew rotten,
   And was pulled down before my birth,
      And is almost forgotten!”

   My right mind woke, and I stood dumb;
      Forty years’ frost and flower
   Had fleeted since I’d used to come
      To meet her in that bower.




WHILE DRAWING IN A CHURCH-YARD


      “IT is sad that so many of worth,
      Still in the flesh,” soughed the yew,
   “Misjudge their lot whom kindly earth
         Secludes from view.

      “They ride their diurnal round
      Each day-span’s sum of hours
   In peerless ease, without jolt or bound
         Or ache like ours.

      “If the living could but hear
      What is heard by my roots as they creep
   Round the restful flock, and the things said there,
         No one would weep.”

      “‘Now set among the wise,’
      They say: ‘Enlarged in scope,
   That no God trumpet us to rise
         We truly hope.’”

      I listened to his strange tale
      In the mood that stillness brings,
   And I grew to accept as the day wore pale
         That show of things.




“FOR LIFE I HAD NEVER CARED GREATLY”


      FOR Life I had never cared greatly,
         As worth a man’s while;
         Peradventures unsought,
      Peradventures that finished in nought,
   Had kept me from youth and through manhood till lately
         Unwon by its style.

      In earliest years—why I know not—
         I viewed it askance;
         Conditions of doubt,
      Conditions that leaked slowly out,
   May haply have bent me to stand and to show not
         Much zest for its dance.

      With symphonies soft and sweet colour
         It courted me then,
         Till evasions seemed wrong,
      Till evasions gave in to its song,
   And I warmed, until living aloofly loomed duller
         Than life among men.

      Anew I found nought to set eyes on,
         When, lifting its hand,
         It uncloaked a star,
      Uncloaked it from fog-damps afar,
   And showed its beams burning from pole to horizon
         As bright as a brand.

      And so, the rough highway forgetting,
         I pace hill and dale
         Regarding the sky,
      Regarding the vision on high,
   And thus re-illumed have no humour for letting
         My pilgrimage fail.




POEMS OF WAR AND PATRIOTISM


“MEN WHO MARCH AWAY”
(SONG OF THE SOLDIERS)


   WHAT of the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away
      Ere the barn-cocks say
      Night is growing gray,
   Leaving all that here can win us;
   What of the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away?

   Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
      Friend with the musing eye,
      Who watch us stepping by
      With doubt and dolorous sigh?
   Can much pondering so hoodwink you!
   Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
      Friend with the musing eye?

   Nay.  We well see what we are doing,
      Though some may not see—
      Dalliers as they be—
      England’s need are we;
   Her distress would leave us rueing:
   Nay.  We well see what we are doing,
      Though some may not see!

   In our heart of hearts believing
      Victory crowns the just,
      And that braggarts must
      Surely bite the dust,
   Press we to the field ungrieving,
   In our heart of hearts believing
      Victory crowns the just.

   Hence the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away
      Ere the barn-cocks say
      Night is growing gray,
   Leaving all that here can win us;
   Hence the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away.

HIS COUNTRY


   [He travels southward, and looks around;]
   I journeyed from my native spot
      Across the south sea shine,
   And found that people in hall and cot
   Laboured and suffered each his lot
      Even as I did mine.

   [and cannot discern the boundary]
   Thus noting them in meads and marts
      It did not seem to me
   That my dear country with its hearts,
   Minds, yearnings, worse and better parts
      Had ended with the sea.

   [of his native country;]
   I further and further went anon,
      As such I still surveyed,
   And further yet—yea, on and on,
   And all the men I looked upon
      Had heart-strings fellow-made.

   [or where his duties to his fellow-creatures end;]
   I traced the whole terrestrial round,
      Homing the other side;
   Then said I, “What is there to bound
   My denizenship?  It seems I have found
      Its scope to be world-wide.”

   [nor who are his enemies]
   I asked me: “Whom have I to fight,
      And whom have I to dare,
   And whom to weaken, crush, and blight?
   My country seems to have kept in sight
      On my way everywhere.”

1913.



ENGLAND TO GERMANY IN 1914


   “O ENGLAND, may God punish thee!”
   —Is it that Teuton genius flowers
   Only to breathe malignity
   Upon its friend of earlier hours?
   —We have eaten your bread, you have eaten ours,
   We have loved your burgs, your pines’ green moan,
   Fair Rhine-stream, and its storied towers;
   Your shining souls of deathless dowers
   Have won us as they were our own:

   We have nursed no dreams to shed your blood,
   We have matched your might not rancorously,
   Save a flushed few whose blatant mood
   You heard and marked as well as we
   To tongue not in their country’s key;
   But yet you cry with face aflame,
   “O England, may God punish thee!”
   And foul in onward history,
   And present sight, your ancient name.

_Autumn_ 1914.



ON THE BELGIAN EXPATRIATION


   I DREAMT that people from the Land of Chimes
   Arrived one autumn morning with their bells,
   To hoist them on the towers and citadels
   Of my own country, that the musical rhymes

   Rung by them into space at meted times
   Amid the market’s daily stir and stress,
   And the night’s empty star-lit silentness,
   Might solace souls of this and kindred climes.

   Then I awoke; and lo, before me stood
   The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear;
   From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend,

   No carillons in their train.  Foes of mad mood
   Had shattered these to shards amid the gear
   Of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end.

_October_ 18, 1914.



AN APPEAL TO AMERICA
ON BEHALF OF THE BELGIAN DESTITUTE


      SEVEN millions stand
   Emaciate, in that ancient Delta-land:—
   We here, full-charged with our own maimed and dead,
   And coiled in throbbing conflicts slow and sore,
   Can poorly soothe these ails unmerited
   Of souls forlorn upon the facing shore!—
   Where naked, gaunt, in endless band on band
      Seven millions stand.

      No man can say
   To your great country that, with scant delay,
   You must, perforce, ease them in their loud need:
   We know that nearer first your duty lies;
   But—is it much to ask that you let plead
   Your lovingkindness with you—wooing-wise—
   Albeit that aught you owe, and must repay,
      No man can say?

_December_ 1914.



THE PITY OF IT


   I WALKED in loamy Wessex lanes, afar
   From rail-track and from highway, and I heard
   In field and farmstead many an ancient word
   Of local lineage like “Thu bist,” “Er war,”

   “Ich woll,” “Er sholl,” and by-talk similar,
   Nigh as they speak who in this month’s moon gird
   At England’s very loins, thereunto spurred
   By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are.

   Then seemed a Heart crying: “Whosoever they be
   At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame
   Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we,

   “Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame;
   May their familiars grow to shun their name,
   And their brood perish everlastingly.”

_April_ 1915.



IN TIME OF WARS AND TUMULTS


   “WOULD that I’d not drawn breath here!” some one said,
   “To stalk upon this stage of evil deeds,
   Where purposelessly month by month proceeds
   A play so sorely shaped and blood-bespread.”

   Yet had his spark not quickened, but lain dead
   To the gross spectacles of this our day,
   And never put on the proffered cloak of clay,
   He had but known not things now manifested;

   Life would have swirled the same.  Morns would have dawned
   On the uprooting by the night-gun’s stroke
   Of what the yester noonshine brought to flower;

   Brown martial brows in dying throes have wanned
   Despite his absence; hearts no fewer been broke
   By Empery’s insatiate lust of power.

1915.



IN TIME OF “THE BREAKING OF NATIONS” {235}


                                    I

   Only a man harrowing clods
      In a slow silent walk
   With an old horse that stumbles and nods
      Half asleep as they stalk.

                                    II

   Only thin smoke without flame
      From the heaps of couch-grass;
   Yet this will go onward the same
      Though Dynasties pass.

                                   III

   Yonder a maid and her wight
      Come whispering by:
   War’s annals will cloud into night
      Ere their story die.

1915.



CRY OF THE HOMELESS
AFTER THE PRUSSIAN INVASION OF BELGIUM


   “INSTIGATOR of the ruin—
      Whichsoever thou mayst be
   Of the masterful of Europe
      That contrived our misery—
   Hear the wormwood-worded greeting
      From each city, shore, and lea
         Of thy victims:
      “Conqueror, all hail to thee!”

   “Yea: ‘All hail!’ we grimly shout thee
      That wast author, fount, and head
   Of these wounds, whoever proven
      When our times are throughly read.
   ‘May thy loved be slighted, blighted,
      And forsaken,’ be it said
         By thy victims,
      ‘And thy children beg their bread!’

   “Nay: a richer malediction!—
      Rather let this thing befall
   In time’s hurling and unfurling
      On the night when comes thy call;
   That compassion dew thy pillow
      And bedrench thy senses all
         For thy victims,
      Till death dark thee with his pall.”

_August_ 1915.



BEFORE MARCHING AND AFTER
(_in Memoriam F. W. G._)


      ORION swung southward aslant
      Where the starved Egdon pine-trees had thinned,
      The Pleiads aloft seemed to pant
      With the heather that twitched in the wind;
   But he looked on indifferent to sights such as these,
   Unswayed by love, friendship, home joy or home sorrow,
   And wondered to what he would march on the morrow.

      The crazed household-clock with its whirr
      Rang midnight within as he stood,
      He heard the low sighing of her
      Who had striven from his birth for his good;
   But he still only asked the spring starlight, the breeze,
   What great thing or small thing his history would borrow
   From that Game with Death he would play on the morrow.

      When the heath wore the robe of late summer,
      And the fuchsia-bells, hot in the sun,
      Hung red by the door, a quick comer
      Brought tidings that marching was done
   For him who had joined in that game overseas
   Where Death stood to win, though his name was to borrow
   A brightness therefrom not to fade on the morrow.

_September_ 1915.



“OFTEN WHEN WARRING”


   OFTEN when warring for he wist not what,
   An enemy-soldier, passing by one weak,
   Has tendered water, wiped the burning cheek,
   And cooled the lips so black and clammed and hot;

   Then gone his way, and maybe quite forgot
   The deed of grace amid the roar and reek;
   Yet larger vision than loud arms bespeak
   He there has reached, although he has known it not.

   For natural mindsight, triumphing in the act
   Over the throes of artificial rage,
   Has thuswise muffled victory’s peal of pride,
   Rended to ribands policy’s specious page
   That deals but with evasion, code, and pact,
   And war’s apology wholly stultified.

1915.



THEN AND NOW


      WHEN battles were fought
   With a chivalrous sense of Should and Ought,
      In spirit men said,
      “End we quick or dead,
      Honour is some reward!
   Let us fight fair—for our own best or worst;
      So, Gentlemen of the Guard,
         Fire first!”

      In the open they stood,
   Man to man in his knightlihood:
      They would not deign
      To profit by a stain
      On the honourable rules,
   Knowing that practise perfidy no man durst
      Who in the heroic schools
         Was nurst.

      But now, behold, what
   Is warfare wherein honour is not!
      Rama laments
      Its dead innocents:
      Herod breathes: “Sly slaughter
   Shall rule!  Let us, by modes once called accurst,
      Overhead, under water,
         Stab first.”

1915.



A CALL TO NATIONAL SERVICE


   UP and be doing, all who have a hand
   To lift, a back to bend.  It must not be
   In times like these that vaguely linger we
   To air our vaunts and hopes; and leave our land

   Untended as a wild of weeds and sand.
   —Say, then, “I come!” and go, O women and men
   Of palace, ploughshare, easel, counter, pen;
   That scareless, scathless, England still may stand.

   Would years but let me stir as once I stirred
   At many a dawn to take the forward track,
   And with a stride plunged on to enterprize,

   I now would speed like yester wind that whirred
   Through yielding pines; and serve with never a slack,
   So loud for promptness all around outcries!

_March_ 1917.



THE DEAD AND THE LIVING ONE


   THE dead woman lay in her first night’s grave,
   And twilight fell from the clouds’ concave,
   And those she had asked to forgive forgave.

   The woman passing came to a pause
   By the heaped white shapes of wreath and cross,
   And looked upon where the other was.

   And as she mused there thus spoke she:
   “Never your countenance did I see,
   But you’ve been a good good friend to me!”

   Rose a plaintive voice from the sod below:
   “O woman whose accents I do not know,
   What is it that makes you approve me so?”

   “O dead one, ere my soldier went,
   I heard him saying, with warm intent,
   To his friend, when won by your blandishment:

   “‘I would change for that lass here and now!
   And if I return I may break my vow
   To my present Love, and contrive somehow

   “‘To call my own this new-found pearl,
   Whose eyes have the light, whose lips the curl,
   I always have looked for in a girl!’

   “—And this is why that by ceasing to be—
   Though never your countenance did I see—
   You prove you a good good friend to me;

   “And I pray each hour for your soul’s repose
   In gratitude for your joining those
   No lover will clasp when his campaigns close.”

   Away she turned, when arose to her eye
   A martial phantom of gory dye,
   That said, with a thin and far-off sigh:

   “O sweetheart, neither shall I clasp you,
   For the foe this day has pierced me through,
   And sent me to where she is.  Adieu!—

   “And forget not when the night-wind’s whine
   Calls over this turf where her limbs recline,
   That it travels on to lament by mine.”

   There was a cry by the white-flowered mound,
   There was a laugh from underground,
   There was a deeper gloom around.

1915.



A NEW YEAR’S EVE IN WAR TIME


                                    I

      PHANTASMAL fears,
      And the flap of the flame,
      And the throb of the clock,
      And a loosened slate,
      And the blind night’s drone,
   Which tiredly the spectral pines intone!

                                    II

   And the blood in my ears
   Strumming always the same,
   And the gable-cock
   With its fitful grate,
   And myself, alone.

                                   III

   The twelfth hour nears
   Hand-hid, as in shame;
   I undo the lock,
   And listen, and wait
   For the Young Unknown.

                                    IV

   In the dark there careers—
   As if Death astride came
   To numb all with his knock—
   A horse at mad rate
   Over rut and stone.

                                    V

   No figure appears,
   No call of my name,
   No sound but “Tic-toc”
   Without check.  Past the gate
   It clatters—is gone.

                                    VI

   What rider it bears
   There is none to proclaim;
   And the Old Year has struck,
   And, scarce animate,
   The New makes moan.

                                   VII

      Maybe that “More Tears!—
      More Famine and Flame—
      More Severance and Shock!”
      Is the order from Fate
      That the Rider speeds on
   To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone.

1915–1916.



“I MET A MAN”


      I MET a man when night was nigh,
      Who said, with shining face and eye
      Like Moses’ after Sinai:—

      “I have seen the Moulder of Monarchies,
         Realms, peoples, plains and hills,
      Sitting upon the sunlit seas!—
      And, as He sat, soliloquies
   Fell from Him like an antiphonic breeze
         That pricks the waves to thrills.

      “Meseemed that of the maimed and dead
         Mown down upon the globe,—
      Their plenteous blooms of promise shed
      Ere fruiting-time—His words were said,
   Sitting against the western web of red
         Wrapt in His crimson robe.

      “And I could catch them now and then:
         —‘Why let these gambling clans
      Of human Cockers, pit liege men
      From mart and city, dale and glen,
   In death-mains, but to swell and swell again
         Their swollen All-Empery plans,

      “‘When a mere nod (if my malign
         Compeer but passive keep)
      Would mend that old mistake of mine
      I made with Saul, and ever consign
   All Lords of War whose sanctuaries enshrine
         Liberticide, to sleep?

      “‘With violence the lands are spread
         Even as in Israel’s day,
      And it repenteth me I bred
      Chartered armipotents lust-led
   To feuds . . . Yea, grieves my heart, as then I said,
         To see their evil way!’

      —“The utterance grew, and flapped like flame,
         And further speech I feared;
      But no Celestial tongued acclaim,
      And no huzzas from earthlings came,
   And the heavens mutely masked as ’twere in shame
         Till daylight disappeared.”

   Thus ended he as night rode high—
   The man of shining face and eye,
   Like Moses’ after Sinai.

1916.



“I LOOKED UP FROM MY WRITING”


   I LOOKED up from my writing,
      And gave a start to see,
   As if rapt in my inditing,
      The moon’s full gaze on me.

   Her meditative misty head
      Was spectral in its air,
   And I involuntarily said,
      “What are you doing there?”

   “Oh, I’ve been scanning pond and hole
      And waterway hereabout
   For the body of one with a sunken soul
      Who has put his life-light out.

   “Did you hear his frenzied tattle?
      It was sorrow for his son
   Who is slain in brutish battle,
      Though he has injured none.

   “And now I am curious to look
      Into the blinkered mind
   Of one who wants to write a book
      In a world of such a kind.”

   Her temper overwrought me,
      And I edged to shun her view,
   For I felt assured she thought me
      One who should drown him too.




FINALE


THE COMING OF THE END


      HOW it came to an end!
   The meeting afar from the crowd,
   And the love-looks and laughters unpenned,
   The parting when much was avowed,
      How it came to an end!

      It came to an end;
   Yes, the outgazing over the stream,
   With the sun on each serpentine bend,
   Or, later, the luring moon-gleam;
      It came to an end.

      It came to an end,
   The housebuilding, furnishing, planting,
   As if there were ages to spend
   In welcoming, feasting, and jaunting;
      It came to an end.

      It came to an end,
   That journey of one day a week:
   (“It always goes on,” said a friend,
   “Just the same in bright weathers or bleak;”)
      But it came to an end.

      “_How_ will come to an end
   This orbit so smoothly begun,
   Unless some convulsion attend?”
   I often said.  “What will be done
      When it comes to an end?”

      Well, it came to an end
   Quite silently—stopped without jerk;
   Better close no prevision could lend;
   Working out as One planned it should work
      Ere it came to an end.



AFTERWARDS


   WHEN the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay,
      And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings,
   Delicate-filmed as new-spun silk, will the neighbours say,
      “He was a man who used to notice such things”?

   If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid’s soundless blink,
      The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight
   Upon the wind-warped upland thorn, a gazer may think,
      “To him this must have been a familiar sight.”

   If I pass during some nocturnal blackness, mothy and warm,
      When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn,
   One may say, “He strove that such innocent creatures should come to no
   harm,
      But he could do little for them; and now he is gone”?

   If, when hearing that I have been stilled at last, they stand at the
   door,
      Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees,
   Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more,
      “He was one who had an eye for such mysteries”?

   And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom,
      And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings,
   Till they rise again, as they were a new bell’s boom,
      “He hears it not now, but used to notice such things”?
V.R.  1819–1901
A REVERIE


   MOMENTS the mightiest pass uncalendared,
         And when the Absolute
      In backward Time outgave the deedful word
         Whereby all life is stirred:
   “Let one be born and throned whose mould shall constitute
   The norm of every royal-reckoned attribute,”
         No mortal knew or heard.
      But in due days the purposed Life outshone—
         Serene, sagacious, free;
      —Her waxing seasons bloomed with deeds well done,
         And the world’s heart was won . . .
   Yet may the deed of hers most bright in eyes to be
   Lie hid from ours—as in the All-One’s thought lay she—
         Till ripening years have run.

WAR POEMS


EMBARCATION
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   HERE, where Vespasian’s legions struck the sands,
   And Cerdic with his Saxons entered in,
   And Henry’s army leapt afloat to win
   Convincing triumphs over neighbour lands,

   Vaster battalions press for further strands,
   To argue in the self-same bloody mode
   Which this late age of thought, and pact, and code,
   Still fails to mend.—Now deckward tramp the bands,
   Yellow as autumn leaves, alive as spring;
   And as each host draws out upon the sea
   Beyond which lies the tragical To-be,
   None dubious of the cause, none murmuring,

   Wives, sisters, parents, wave white hands and smile,
   As if they knew not that they weep the while.



DEPARTURE
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   WHILE the far farewell music thins and fails,
   And the broad bottoms rip the bearing brine—
   All smalling slowly to the gray sea line—
   And each significant red smoke-shaft pales,

   Keen sense of severance everywhere prevails,
   Which shapes the late long tramp of mounting men
   To seeming words that ask and ask again:
   “How long, O striving Teutons, Slavs, and Gaels
   Must your wroth reasonings trade on lives like these,
   That are as puppets in a playing hand?—
   When shall the saner softer polities
   Whereof we dream, have play in each proud land,
   And patriotism, grown Godlike, scorn to stand
   Bondslave to realms, but circle earth and seas?”



THE COLONEL’S SOLILOQUY
(_Southampton Docks_: _October_, 1899)


   “THE quay recedes.   Hurrah!  Ahead we go! . . .
   It’s true I’ve been accustomed now to home,
   And joints get rusty, and one’s limbs may grow
      More fit to rest than roam.

   “But I can stand as yet fair stress and strain;
   There’s not a little steel beneath the rust;
   My years mount somewhat, but here’s to’t again!
      And if I fall, I must.

   “God knows that for myself I’ve scanty care;
   Past scrimmages have proved as much to all;
   In Eastern lands and South I’ve had my share
      Both of the blade and ball.

   “And where those villains ripped me in the flitch
   With their old iron in my early time,
   I’m apt at change of wind to feel a twitch,
      Or at a change of clime.

   “And what my mirror shows me in the morning
   Has more of blotch and wrinkle than of bloom;
   My eyes, too, heretofore all glasses scorning,
      Have just a touch of rheum . . .

   “Now sounds ‘The Girl I’ve left behind me,’—Ah,
   The years, the ardours, wakened by that tune!
   Time was when, with the crowd’s farewell ‘Hurrah!’
      ’Twould lift me to the moon.

   “But now it’s late to leave behind me one
   Who if, poor soul, her man goes underground,
   Will not recover as she might have done
      In days when hopes abound.

   “She’s waving from the wharfside, palely grieving,
   As down we draw . . . Her tears make little show,
   Yet now she suffers more than at my leaving
      Some twenty years ago.

   “I pray those left at home will care for her!
   I shall come back; I have before; though when
   The Girl you leave behind you is a grandmother,
      Things may not be as then.”



THE GOING OF THE BATTERY
WIVES’ LAMENT
(_November_ 2, 1899)


                                    I

   O IT was sad enough, weak enough, mad enough—
   Light in their loving as soldiers can be—
   First to risk choosing them, leave alone losing them
   Now, in far battle, beyond the South Sea! . . .

                                    II

   —Rain came down drenchingly; but we unblenchingly
   Trudged on beside them through mirk and through mire,
   They stepping steadily—only too readily!—
   Scarce as if stepping brought parting-time nigher.

                                   III

   Great guns were gleaming there, living things seeming there,
   Cloaked in their tar-cloths, upmouthed to the night;
   Wheels wet and yellow from axle to felloe,
   Throats blank of sound, but prophetic to sight.

                                    IV

   Gas-glimmers drearily, blearily, eerily
   Lit our pale faces outstretched for one kiss,
   While we stood prest to them, with a last quest to them
   Not to court perils that honour could miss.

                                    V

   Sharp were those sighs of ours, blinded these eyes of ours,
   When at last moved away under the arch
   All we loved.   Aid for them each woman prayed for them,
   Treading back slowly the track of their march.

                                    VI

   Someone said: “Nevermore will they come: evermore
   Are they now lost to us.”  O it was wrong!
   Though may be hard their ways, some Hand will guard their ways,
   Bear them through safely, in brief time or long.

                                   VII

   —Yet, voices haunting us, daunting us, taunting us,
   Hint in the night-time when life beats are low
   Other and graver things . . . Hold we to braver things,
   Wait we, in trust, what Time’s fulness shall show.



AT THE WAR OFFICE, LONDON
(_Affixing the Lists of Killed and Wounded_: _December_, 1899)


                                    I

   LAST year I called this world of gain-givings
   The darkest thinkable, and questioned sadly
   If my own land could heave its pulse less gladly,
   So charged it seemed with circumstance whence springs
      The tragedy of things.

                                    II

   Yet at that censured time no heart was rent
   Or feature blanched of parent, wife, or daughter
   By hourly blazoned sheets of listed slaughter;
   Death waited Nature’s wont; Peace smiled unshent
      From Ind to Occident.



A CHRISTMAS GHOST-STORY


   SOUTH of the Line, inland from far Durban,
   A mouldering soldier lies—your countryman.
   Awry and doubled up are his gray bones,
   And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans
   Nightly to clear Canopus: “I would know
   By whom and when the All-Earth-gladdening Law
   Of Peace, brought in by that Man Crucified,
   Was ruled to be inept, and set aside?
   And what of logic or of truth appears
   In tacking ‘Anno Domini’ to the years?
   Near twenty-hundred livened thus have hied,
   But tarries yet the Cause for which He died.”

_Christmas-eve_, 1899.



THE DEAD DRUMMER


                                    I

   THEY throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest
      Uncoffined—just as found:
   His landmark is a kopje-crest
      That breaks the veldt around;
   And foreign constellations west
      Each night above his mound.

                                    II

   Young Hodge the Drummer never knew—
      Fresh from his Wessex home—
   The meaning of the broad Karoo,
      The Bush, the dusty loam,
   And why uprose to nightly view
      Strange stars amid the gloam.

                                   III

   Yet portion of that unknown plain
      Will Hodge for ever be;
   His homely Northern breast and brain
      Grow up a Southern tree.
   And strange-eyed constellations reign
      His stars eternally.



A WIFE IN LONDON
(_December_, 1899)


                                    I
                               THE TRAGEDY

   SHE sits in the tawny vapour
         That the City lanes have uprolled,
         Behind whose webby fold on fold
   Like a waning taper
      The street-lamp glimmers cold.

   A messenger’s knock cracks smartly,
         Flashed news is in her hand
         Of meaning it dazes to understand
   Though shaped so shortly:
      _He—has fallen—in the far South Land_ . . .

                                    II
                                THE IRONY

   ’Tis the morrow; the fog hangs thicker,
         The postman nears and goes:
         A letter is brought whose lines disclose
   By the firelight flicker
      His hand, whom the worm now knows:

   Fresh—firm—penned in highest feather—
         Page-full of his hoped return,
         And of home-planned jaunts by brake and burn
   In the summer weather,
      And of new love that they would learn.



THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN


                                    I

      The thick lids of Night closed upon me
         Alone at the Bill
         Of the Isle by the Race {253}—
      Many-caverned, bald, wrinkled of face—
   And with darkness and silence the spirit was on me
         To brood and be still.

                                    II

      No wind fanned the flats of the ocean,
         Or promontory sides,
         Or the ooze by the strand,
      Or the bent-bearded slope of the land,
   Whose base took its rest amid everlong motion
         Of criss-crossing tides.

                                   III

      Soon from out of the Southward seemed nearing
         A whirr, as of wings
         Waved by mighty-vanned flies,
      Or by night-moths of measureless size,
   And in softness and smoothness well-nigh beyond hearing
         Of corporal things.

                                    IV

      And they bore to the bluff, and alighted—
         A dim-discerned train
         Of sprites without mould,
      Frameless souls none might touch or might hold—
   On the ledge by the turreted lantern, farsighted
         By men of the main.

                                    V

      And I heard them say “Home!” and I knew them
         For souls of the felled
         On the earth’s nether bord
      Under Capricorn, whither they’d warred,
   And I neared in my awe, and gave heedfulness to them
         With breathings inheld.

                                    VI

      Then, it seemed, there approached from the northward
         A senior soul-flame
         Of the like filmy hue:
      And he met them and spake: “Is it you,
   O my men?”  Said they, “Aye!  We bear homeward and hearthward
         To list to our fame!”

                                   VII

      “I’ve flown there before you,” he said then:
         “Your households are well;
         But—your kin linger less
      On your glory arid war-mightiness
   Than on dearer things.”—“Dearer?” cried these from the dead then,
         “Of what do they tell?”

                                   VIII

      “Some mothers muse sadly, and murmur
         Your doings as boys—
         Recall the quaint ways
      Of your babyhood’s innocent days.
   Some pray that, ere dying, your faith had grown firmer,
         And higher your joys.

                                    IX

      “A father broods: ‘Would I had set him
         To some humble trade,
         And so slacked his high fire,
      And his passionate martial desire;
   Had told him no stories to woo him and whet him
         To this due crusade!”

                                    X

      “And, General, how hold out our sweethearts,
         Sworn loyal as doves?”
         —“Many mourn; many think
      It is not unattractive to prink
   Them in sables for heroes.   Some fickle and fleet hearts
         Have found them new loves.”

                                    XI

      “And our wives?” quoth another resignedly,
         “Dwell they on our deeds?”
         —“Deeds of home; that live yet
      Fresh as new—deeds of fondness or fret;
   Ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly,
         These, these have their heeds.”

                                   XII

      —“Alas! then it seems that our glory
         Weighs less in their thought
         Than our old homely acts,
      And the long-ago commonplace facts
   Of our lives—held by us as scarce part of our story,
         And rated as nought!”

                                   XIII

      Then bitterly some: “Was it wise now
         To raise the tomb-door
         For such knowledge?  Away!”
      But the rest: “Fame we prized till to-day;
   Yet that hearts keep us green for old kindness we prize now
         A thousand times more!”

                                   XIV

      Thus speaking, the trooped apparitions
         Began to disband
         And resolve them in two:
      Those whose record was lovely and true
   Bore to northward for home: those of bitter traditions
         Again left the land,

                                    XV

      And, towering to seaward in legions,
         They paused at a spot
         Overbending the Race—
      That engulphing, ghast, sinister place—
   Whither headlong they plunged, to the fathomless regions
         Of myriads forgot.

                                   XVI

      And the spirits of those who were homing
         Passed on, rushingly,
         Like the Pentecost Wind;
      And the whirr of their wayfaring thinned
   And surceased on the sky, and but left in the gloaming
         Sea-mutterings and me.

_December_ 1899.



SONG OF THE SOLDIERS’ WIVES


                                    I

   AT last!  In sight of home again,
         Of home again;
   No more to range and roam again
      As at that bygone time?
   No more to go away from us
         And stay from us?—
   Dawn, hold not long the day from us,
      But quicken it to prime!

                                    II

   Now all the town shall ring to them,
         Shall ring to them,
   And we who love them cling to them
      And clasp them joyfully;
   And cry, “O much we’ll do for you
         Anew for you,
   Dear Loves!—aye, draw and hew for you,
      Come back from oversea.”

                                   III

   Some told us we should meet no more,
         Should meet no more;
   Should wait, and wish, but greet no more
      Your faces round our fires;
   That, in a while, uncharily
         And drearily
   Men gave their lives—even wearily,
      Like those whom living tires.

                                    IV

   And now you are nearing home again,
         Dears, home again;
   No more, may be, to roam again
      As at that bygone time,
   Which took you far away from us
         To stay from us;
   Dawn, hold not long the day from us,
      But quicken it to prime!



THE SICK GOD


                                    I

      IN days when men had joy of war,
   A God of Battles sped each mortal jar;
      The peoples pledged him heart and hand,
      From Israel’s land to isles afar.

                                    II

      His crimson form, with clang and chime,
   Flashed on each murk and murderous meeting-time,
      And kings invoked, for rape and raid,
      His fearsome aid in rune and rhyme.

                                   III

      On bruise and blood-hole, scar and seam,
   On blade and bolt, he flung his fulgid beam:
      His haloes rayed the very gore,
      And corpses wore his glory-gleam.

                                    IV

      Often an early King or Queen,
   And storied hero onward, knew his sheen;
      ’Twas glimpsed by Wolfe, by Ney anon,
      And Nelson on his blue demesne.

                                    V

      But new light spread.  That god’s gold nimb
   And blazon have waned dimmer and more dim;
      Even his flushed form begins to fade,
      Till but a shade is left of him.

                                    VI

      That modern meditation broke
   His spell, that penmen’s pleadings dealt a stroke,
      Say some; and some that crimes too dire
      Did much to mire his crimson cloak.

                                   VII

      Yea, seeds of crescive sympathy
   Were sown by those more excellent than he,
      Long known, though long contemned till then—
      The gods of men in amity.

                                   VIII

      Souls have grown seers, and thought out-brings
   The mournful many-sidedness of things
      With foes as friends, enfeebling ires
      And fury-fires by gaingivings!

                                    IX

      He scarce impassions champions now;
   They do and dare, but tensely—pale of brow;
      And would they fain uplift the arm
      Of that faint form they know not how.

                                    X

      Yet wars arise, though zest grows cold;
   Wherefore, at whiles, as ’twere in ancient mould
      He looms, bepatched with paint and lath;
      But never hath he seemed the old!

                                    XI

      Let men rejoice, let men deplore.
   The lurid Deity of heretofore
      Succumbs to one of saner nod;
      The Battle-god is god no more.




POEMS OF PILGRIMAGE


GENOA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN
(March, 1887)


      O EPIC-FAMED, god-haunted Central Sea,
      Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee
   When from Torino’s track I saw thy face first flash on me.

      And multimarbled Genova the Proud,
      Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed,
   I first beheld thee clad—not as the Beauty but the Dowd.

      Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit
      On housebacks pink, green, ochreous—where a slit
   Shoreward ’twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it.

      And thereacross waved fishwives’ high-hung smocks,
      Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks;
   Since when too oft my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks:

      Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours
      Within Palazzo Doria’s orange bowers
   Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers.

      But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see,
      Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be
   Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee.



SHELLEY’S SKYLARK
(_The neighbourhood of Leghorn_: _March_, 1887)


   SOMEWHERE afield here something lies
   In Earth’s oblivious eyeless trust
   That moved a poet to prophecies—
   A pinch of unseen, unguarded dust

   The dust of the lark that Shelley heard,
   And made immortal through times to be;—
   Though it only lived like another bird,
   And knew not its immortality.

   Lived its meek life; then, one day, fell—
   A little ball of feather and bone;
   And how it perished, when piped farewell,
   And where it wastes, are alike unknown.

   Maybe it rests in the loam I view,
   Maybe it throbs in a myrtle’s green,
   Maybe it sleeps in the coming hue
   Of a grape on the slopes of yon inland scene.

   Go find it, faeries, go and find
   That tiny pinch of priceless dust,
   And bring a casket silver-lined,
   And framed of gold that gems encrust;

   And we will lay it safe therein,
   And consecrate it to endless time;
   For it inspired a bard to win
   Ecstatic heights in thought and rhyme.



IN THE OLD THEATRE, FIESOLE
(_April_, 1887)


   I TRACED the Circus whose gray stones incline
   Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin,
   Till came a child who showed an ancient coin
   That bore the image of a Constantine.

   She lightly passed; nor did she once opine
   How, better than all books, she had raised for me
   In swift perspective Europe’s history
   Through the vast years of Cæsar’s sceptred line.

   For in my distant plot of English loam
   ’Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find
   Coins of like impress.  As with one half blind
   Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home
   In that mute moment to my opened mind
   The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.



ROME: ON THE PALATINE
(_April_, 1887)


   WE walked where Victor Jove was shrined awhile,
   And passed to Livia’s rich red mural show,
   Whence, thridding cave and Criptoportico,
   We gained Caligula’s dissolving pile.

   And each ranked ruin tended to beguile
   The outer sense, and shape itself as though
   It wore its marble hues, its pristine glow
   Of scenic frieze and pompous peristyle.

   When lo, swift hands, on strings nigh over-head,
   Began to melodize a waltz by Strauss:
   It stirred me as I stood, in Cæsar’s house,
   Raised the old routs Imperial lyres had led,

   And blended pulsing life with lives long done,
   Till Time seemed fiction, Past and Present one.



ROME
BUILDING A NEW STREET IN THE ANCIENT QUARTER
(_April_, 1887)


   THESE numbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry
   Outskeleton Time’s central city, Rome;
   Whereof each arch, entablature, and dome
   Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy.

   And cracking frieze and rotten metope
   Express, as though they were an open tome
   Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome;
   “Dunces, Learn here to spell Humanity!”

   And yet within these ruins’ very shade
   The singing workmen shape and set and join
   Their frail new mansion’s stuccoed cove and quoin
   With no apparent sense that years abrade,
   Though each rent wall their feeble works invade
   Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin.



ROME
THE VATICAN—SALA DELLE MUSE
(1887)


   I SAT in the Muses’ Hall at the mid of the day,
   And it seemed to grow still, and the people to pass away,
   And the chiselled shapes to combine in a haze of sun,
   Till beside a Carrara column there gleamed forth One.

   She was nor this nor that of those beings divine,
   But each and the whole—an essence of all the Nine;
   With tentative foot she neared to my halting-place,
   A pensive smile on her sweet, small, marvellous face.

   “Regarded so long, we render thee sad?” said she.
   “Not you,” sighed I, “but my own inconstancy!
   I worship each and each; in the morning one,
   And then, alas! another at sink of sun.

   “To-day my soul clasps Form; but where is my troth
   Of yesternight with Tune: can one cleave to both?”
   —“Be not perturbed,” said she.  “Though apart in fame,
   As I and my sisters are one, those, too, are the same.

   —“But my loves go further—to Story, and Dance, and Hymn,
   The lover of all in a sun-sweep is fool to whim—
   Is swayed like a river-weed as the ripples run!”
   —“Nay, wight, thou sway’st not.  These are but phases of one;

   “And that one is I; and I am projected from thee,
   One that out of thy brain and heart thou causest to be—
   Extern to thee nothing.  Grieve not, nor thyself becall,
   Woo where thou wilt; and rejoice thou canst love at all!”



ROME
AT THE PYRAMID OF CESTIUS
NEAR THE GRAVES OF SHELLEY AND KEATS
(1887)


         WHO, then, was Cestius,
         And what is he to me?—
   Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous
         One thought alone brings he.

         I can recall no word
         Of anything he did;
   For me he is a man who died and was interred
         To leave a pyramid

         Whose purpose was exprest
         Not with its first design,
   Nor till, far down in Time, beside it found their rest
         Two countrymen of mine.

         Cestius in life, maybe,
         Slew, breathed out threatening;
   I know not.  This I know: in death all silently
         He does a kindlier thing,

         In beckoning pilgrim feet
         With marble finger high
   To where, by shadowy wall and history-haunted street,
         Those matchless singers lie . . .

         —Say, then, he lived and died
         That stones which bear his name
   Should mark, through Time, where two immortal Shades abide;
         It is an ample fame.



LAUSANNE
IN GIBBON’S OLD GARDEN: 11–12 P.M.
_June_ 27, 1897


(_The_ 110_th_ _anniversary of the completion of the_ “_Decline and
Fall_” _at the same hour and place_)

         A SPIRIT seems to pass,
      Formal in pose, but grave and grand withal:
      He contemplates a volume stout and tall,
   And far lamps fleck him through the thin acacias.

         Anon the book is closed,
      With “It is finished!”  And at the alley’s end
      He turns, and soon on me his glances bend;
   And, as from earth, comes speech—small, muted, yet composed.

         “How fares the Truth now?—Ill?
      —Do pens but slily further her advance?
      May one not speed her but in phrase askance?
   Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend still?

         “Still rule those minds on earth
      At whom sage Milton’s wormwood words were hurled:
      ‘_Truth like a bastard comes into the world_
   _Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth_’?”



ZERMATT
TO THE MATTERHORN
(_June_-_July_, 1897)


   THIRTY-TWO years since, up against the sun,
   Seven shapes, thin atomies to lower sight,
   Labouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height,
   And four lives paid for what the seven had won.

   They were the first by whom the deed was done,
   And when I look at thee, my mind takes flight
   To that day’s tragic feat of manly might,
   As though, till then, of history thou hadst none.

   Yet ages ere men topped thee, late and soon
   Thou watch’dst each night the planets lift and lower;
   Thou gleam’dst to Joshua’s pausing sun and moon,
   And brav’dst the tokening sky when Cæsar’s power
   Approached its bloody end: yea, saw’st that Noon
   When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour.



THE BRIDGE OF LODI {290}
(_Spring_, 1887)


                                    I

   WHEN of tender mind and body
      I was moved by minstrelsy,
   And that strain “The Bridge of Lodi”
      Brought a strange delight to me.

                                    II

   In the battle-breathing jingle
      Of its forward-footing tune
   I could see the armies mingle,
      And the columns cleft and hewn

                                   III

   On that far-famed spot by Lodi
      Where Napoleon clove his way
   To his fame, when like a god he
      Bent the nations to his sway.

                                    IV

   Hence the tune came capering to me
      While I traced the Rhone and Po;
   Nor could Milan’s Marvel woo me
      From the spot englamoured so.

                                    V

   And to-day, sunlit and smiling,
      Here I stand upon the scene,
   With its saffron walls, dun tiling,
      And its meads of maiden green,

                                    VI

   Even as when the trackway thundered
      With the charge of grenadiers,
   And the blood of forty hundred
      Splashed its parapets and piers . . .

                                   VII

   Any ancient crone I’d toady
      Like a lass in young-eyed prime,
   Could she tell some tale of Lodi
      At that moving mighty time.

                                   VIII

   So, I ask the wives of Lodi
      For traditions of that day;
   But alas! not anybody
      Seems to know of such a fray.

                                    IX

   And they heed but transitory
      Marketings in cheese and meat,
   Till I judge that Lodi’s story
      Is extinct in Lodi’s street.

                                    X

   Yet while here and there they thrid them
      In their zest to sell and buy,
   Let me sit me down amid them
      And behold those thousands die . . .

                                    XI

   —Not a creature cares in Lodi
      How Napoleon swept each arch,
   Or where up and downward trod he,
      Or for his memorial March!

                                   XII

   So that wherefore should I be here,
      Watching Adda lip the lea,
   When the whole romance to see here
      Is the dream I bring with me?

                                   XIII

   And why sing “The Bridge of Lodi”
      As I sit thereon and swing,
   When none shows by smile or nod he
      Guesses why or what I sing? . . .

                                   XIV

   Since all Lodi, low and head ones,
      Seem to pass that story by,
   It may be the Lodi-bred ones
      Rate it truly, and not I.

                                    XV

   Once engrossing Bridge of Lodi,
      Is thy claim to glory gone?
   Must I pipe a palinody,
      Or be silent thereupon?

                                   XVI

   And if here, from strand to steeple,
      Be no stone to fame the fight,
   Must I say the Lodi people
      Are but viewing crime aright?

                                   XVII

   Nay; I’ll sing “The Bridge of Lodi”—
      That long-loved, romantic thing,
   Though none show by smile or nod he
      Guesses why and what I sing!



ON AN INVITATION TO THE UNITED STATES


                                    I

   MY ardours for emprize nigh lost
   Since Life has bared its bones to me,
   I shrink to seek a modern coast
   Whose riper times have yet to be;
   Where the new regions claim them free
   From that long drip of human tears
   Which peoples old in tragedy
   Have left upon the centuried years.

                                    II

   For, wonning in these ancient lands,
   Enchased and lettered as a tomb,
   And scored with prints of perished hands,
   And chronicled with dates of doom,
   Though my own Being bear no bloom
   I trace the lives such scenes enshrine,
   Give past exemplars present room,
   And their experience count as mine.




MISCELLANEOUS POEMS


THE MOTHER MOURNS


   WHEN mid-autumn’s moan shook the night-time,
      And sedges were horny,
   And summer’s green wonderwork faltered
      On leaze and in lane,

   I fared Yell’ham-Firs way, where dimly
      Came wheeling around me
   Those phantoms obscure and insistent
      That shadows unchain.

   Till airs from the needle-thicks brought me
      A low lamentation,
   As ’twere of a tree-god disheartened,
      Perplexed, or in pain.

   And, heeding, it awed me to gather
      That Nature herself there
   Was breathing in aërie accents,
      With dirgeful refrain,

   Weary plaint that Mankind, in these late days,
      Had grieved her by holding
   Her ancient high fame of perfection
      In doubt and disdain . . .

   —“I had not proposed me a Creature
      (She soughed) so excelling
   All else of my kingdom in compass
      And brightness of brain

   “As to read my defects with a god-glance,
      Uncover each vestige
   Of old inadvertence, annunciate
      Each flaw and each stain!

   “My purpose went not to develop
      Such insight in Earthland;
   Such potent appraisements affront me,
      And sadden my reign!

   “Why loosened I olden control here
      To mechanize skywards,
   Undeeming great scope could outshape in
      A globe of such grain?

   “Man’s mountings of mind-sight I checked not,
      Till range of his vision
   Has topped my intent, and found blemish
      Throughout my domain.

   “He holds as inept his own soul-shell—
      My deftest achievement—
   Contemns me for fitful inventions
      Ill-timed and inane:

   “No more sees my sun as a Sanct-shape,
      My moon as the Night-queen,
   My stars as august and sublime ones
      That influences rain:

   “Reckons gross and ignoble my teaching,
      Immoral my story,
   My love-lights a lure, that my species
      May gather and gain.

   “‘Give me,’ he has said, ‘but the matter
      And means the gods lot her,
   My brain could evolve a creation
      More seemly, more sane.’

   —“If ever a naughtiness seized me
      To woo adulation
   From creatures more keen than those crude ones
      That first formed my train—

   “If inly a moment I murmured,
      ‘The simple praise sweetly,
   But sweetlier the sage’—and did rashly
      Man’s vision unrein,

   “I rue it! . . . His guileless forerunners,
      Whose brains I could blandish,
   To measure the deeps of my mysteries
      Applied them in vain.

   “From them my waste aimings and futile
      I subtly could cover;
   ‘Every best thing,’ said they, ‘to best purpose
      Her powers preordain.’—

   “No more such! . . . My species are dwindling,
      My forests grow barren,
   My popinjays fail from their tappings,
      My larks from their strain.

   “My leopardine beauties are rarer,
      My tusky ones vanish,
   My children have aped mine own slaughters
      To quicken my wane.

   “Let me grow, then, but mildews and mandrakes,
      And slimy distortions,
   Let nevermore things good and lovely
      To me appertain;

   “For Reason is rank in my temples,
      And Vision unruly,
   And chivalrous laud of my cunning
      Is heard not again!”



“I SAID TO LOVE”


         I SAID to Love,
   “It is not now as in old days
   When men adored thee and thy ways
         All else above;
   Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One
   Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,”
         I said to Love.

         I said to him,
   “We now know more of thee than then;
   We were but weak in judgment when,
         With hearts abrim,
   We clamoured thee that thou would’st please
   Inflict on us thine agonies,”
         I said to him.

         I said to Love,
   “Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
   No faery darts, no cherub air,
         Nor swan, nor dove
   Are thine; but features pitiless,
   And iron daggers of distress,”
         I said to Love.

         “Depart then, Love! . . .
   —Man’s race shall end, dost threaten thou?
   The age to come the man of now
         Know nothing of?—
   We fear not such a threat from thee;
   We are too old in apathy!
   _Mankind shall cease_.—So let it be,”
         I said to Love.



A COMMONPLACE DAY


      THE day is turning ghost,
   And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively,
      To join the anonymous host
   Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe,
      To one of like degree.

      I part the fire-gnawed logs,
   Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends
      Upon the shining dogs;
   Further and further from the nooks the twilight’s stride extends,
      And beamless black impends.

      Nothing of tiniest worth
   Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or
   praise,
      Since the pale corpse-like birth
   Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays—
      Dullest of dull-hued Days!

      Wanly upon the panes
   The rain slides as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and
   yet
      Here, while Day’s presence wanes,
   And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set,
      He wakens my regret.

      Regret—though nothing dear
   That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime,
      Or bloomed elsewhere than here,
   To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime,
      Or mark him out in Time . . .

      —Yet, maybe, in some soul,
   In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose,
      Or some intent upstole
   Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows
      The world’s amendment flows;

      But which, benumbed at birth
   By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be
      Embodied on the earth;
   And undervoicings of this loss to man’s futurity
      May wake regret in me.



AT A LUNAR ECLIPSE


   THY shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
   Now steals along upon the Moon’s meek shine
   In even monochrome and curving line
   Of imperturbable serenity.

   How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry
   With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
   That profile, placid as a brow divine,
   With continents of moil and misery?

   And can immense Mortality but throw
   So small a shade, and Heaven’s high human scheme
   Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies?

   Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show,
   Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
   Heroes, and women fairer than the skies?



THE LACKING SENSE


             SCENE.—_A sad-coloured landscape_, _Waddon Vale_

                                    I

   “O TIME, whence comes the Mother’s moody look amid her labours,
      As of one who all unwittingly has wounded where she loves?
      Why weaves she not her world-webs to according lutes and tabors,
   With nevermore this too remorseful air upon her face,
         As of angel fallen from grace?”

                                    II

   —“Her look is but her story: construe not its symbols keenly:
      In her wonderworks yea surely has she wounded where she loves.
      The sense of ills misdealt for blisses blanks the mien most
   queenly,
   Self-smitings kill self-joys; and everywhere beneath the sun
         Such deeds her hands have done.”

                                   III

   —“And how explains thy Ancient Mind her crimes upon her creatures,
      These fallings from her fair beginnings, woundings where she loves,
      Into her would-be perfect motions, modes, effects, and features
   Admitting cramps, black humours, wan decay, and baleful blights,
         Distress into delights?”

                                    IV

   —“Ah! know’st thou not her secret yet, her vainly veiled deficience,
      Whence it comes that all unwittingly she wounds the lives she
   loves?
      That sightless are those orbs of hers?—which bar to her omniscience
   Brings those fearful unfulfilments, that red ravage through her zones
         Whereat all creation groans.

                                    V

   “She whispers it in each pathetic strenuous slow endeavour,
      When in mothering she unwittingly sets wounds on what she loves;
      Yet her primal doom pursues her, faultful, fatal is she ever;
   Though so deft and nigh to vision is her facile finger-touch
         That the seers marvel much.

                                    VI

   “Deal, then, her groping skill no scorn, no note of malediction;
      Not long on thee will press the hand that hurts the lives it loves;
      And while she dares dead-reckoning on, in darkness of affliction,
   Assist her where thy creaturely dependence can or may,
         For thou art of her clay.”



TO LIFE


      O LIFE with the sad seared face,
         I weary of seeing thee,
   And thy draggled cloak, and thy hobbling pace,
         And thy too-forced pleasantry!

      I know what thou would’st tell
         Of Death, Time, Destiny—
   I have known it long, and know, too, well
         What it all means for me.

      But canst thou not array
         Thyself in rare disguise,
   And feign like truth, for one mad day,
         That Earth is Paradise?

      I’ll tune me to the mood,
         And mumm with thee till eve;
   And maybe what as interlude
         I feign, I shall believe!



DOOM AND SHE


                                    I

      THERE dwells a mighty pair—
      Slow, statuesque, intense—
      Amid the vague Immense:
   None can their chronicle declare,
      Nor why they be, nor whence.

                                    II

      Mother of all things made,
      Matchless in artistry,
      Unlit with sight is she.—
   And though her ever well-obeyed
      Vacant of feeling he.

                                   III

      The Matron mildly asks—
      A throb in every word—
      “Our clay-made creatures, lord,
   How fare they in their mortal tasks
      Upon Earth’s bounded bord?

                                    IV

      “The fate of those I bear,
      Dear lord, pray turn and view,
      And notify me true;
   Shapings that eyelessly I dare
      Maybe I would undo.

                                    V

      “Sometimes from lairs of life
      Methinks I catch a groan,
      Or multitudinous moan,
   As though I had schemed a world of strife,
      Working by touch alone.”

                                    VI

      “World-weaver!” he replies,
      “I scan all thy domain;
      But since nor joy nor pain
   Doth my clear substance recognize,
      I read thy realms in vain.

                                   VII

      “World-weaver! what _is_ Grief?
      And what are Right, and Wrong,
      And Feeling, that belong
   To creatures all who owe thee fief?
      What worse is Weak than Strong?” . . .

                                   VIII

      —Unlightened, curious, meek,
      She broods in sad surmise . . .
      —Some say they have heard her sighs
   On Alpine height or Polar peak
      When the night tempests rise.



THE PROBLEM


      SHALL we conceal the Case, or tell it—
         We who believe the evidence?
      Here and there the watch-towers knell it
         With a sullen significance,
   Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained
   sense.

      Hearts that are happiest hold not by it;
         Better we let, then, the old view reign;
      Since there is peace in it, why decry it?
         Since there is comfort, why disdain?
   Note not the pigment the while that the painting determines humanity’s
   joy and pain!



THE SUBALTERNS


                                    I

   “POOR wanderer,” said the leaden sky,
      “I fain would lighten thee,
   But there be laws in force on high
      Which say it must not be.”

                                    II

   —“I would not freeze thee, shorn one,” cried
      The North, “knew I but how
   To warm my breath, to slack my stride;
      But I am ruled as thou.”

                                   III

   —“To-morrow I attack thee, wight,”
      Said Sickness.  “Yet I swear
   I bear thy little ark no spite,
      But am bid enter there.”

                                    IV

   —“Come hither, Son,” I heard Death say;
      “I did not will a grave
   Should end thy pilgrimage to-day,
      But I, too, am a slave!”

                                    V

   We smiled upon each other then,
      And life to me wore less
   That fell contour it wore ere when
      They owned their passiveness.



THE SLEEP-WORKER


   WHEN wilt thou wake, O Mother, wake and see—
   As one who, held in trance, has laboured long
   By vacant rote and prepossession strong—
   The coils that thou hast wrought unwittingly;

   Wherein have place, unrealized by thee,
   Fair growths, foul cankers, right enmeshed with wrong,
   Strange orchestras of victim-shriek and song,
   And curious blends of ache and ecstasy?—

   Should that morn come, and show thy opened eyes
   All that Life’s palpitating tissues feel,
   How wilt thou bear thyself in thy surprise?—

   Wilt thou destroy, in one wild shock of shame,
   Thy whole high heaving firmamental frame,
   Or patiently adjust, amend, and heal?



THE BULLFINCHES


      BROTHER Bulleys, let us sing
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.

      When I flew to Blackmoor Vale,
      Whence the green-gowned faeries hail,
   Roosting near them I could hear them
      Speak of queenly Nature’s ways,
      Means, and moods,—well known to fays.

      All we creatures, nigh and far
      (Said they there), the Mother’s are:
   Yet she never shows endeavour
      To protect from warrings wild
      Bird or beast she calls her child.

      Busy in her handsome house
      Known as Space, she falls a-drowse;
   Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming,
      While beneath her groping hands
      Fiends make havoc in her bands.

      How her hussif’ry succeeds
      She unknows or she unheeds,
   All things making for Death’s taking!
      —So the green-gowned faeries say
      Living over Blackmoor way.

      Come then, brethren, let us sing,
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.



GOD-FORGOTTEN


      I TOWERED far, and lo!  I stood within
      The presence of the Lord Most High,
   Sent thither by the sons of earth, to win
         Some answer to their cry.

      —“The Earth, say’st thou?  The Human race?
      By Me created?  Sad its lot?
   Nay: I have no remembrance of such place:
         Such world I fashioned not.”—

      —“O Lord, forgive me when I say
      Thou spak’st the word, and mad’st it all.”—
   “The Earth of men—let me bethink me . . . Yea!
         I dimly do recall

      “Some tiny sphere I built long back
      (Mid millions of such shapes of mine)
   So named . . . It perished, surely—not a wrack
         Remaining, or a sign?

      “It lost my interest from the first,
      My aims therefor succeeding ill;
   Haply it died of doing as it durst?”—
         “Lord, it existeth still.”—

      “Dark, then, its life!  For not a cry
      Of aught it bears do I now hear;
   Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby
         Its plaints had reached mine ear.

      “It used to ask for gifts of good,
      Till came its severance self-entailed,
   When sudden silence on that side ensued,
         And has till now prevailed.

      “All other orbs have kept in touch;
      Their voicings reach me speedily:
   Thy people took upon them overmuch
         In sundering them from me!

      “And it is strange—though sad enough—
      Earth’s race should think that one whose call
   Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
         Must heed their tainted ball! . . .

      “But say’st thou ’tis by pangs distraught,
      And strife, and silent suffering?—
   Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
         Even on so poor a thing!

      “Thou should’st have learnt that _Not to Mend_
      For Me could mean but _Not to Know_:
   Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end
         To what men undergo.” . . .

      Homing at dawn, I thought to see
      One of the Messengers standing by.
   —Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
         When trouble hovers nigh.



THE BEDRIDDEN PEASANT
TO AN UNKNOWING GOD


   MUCH wonder I—here long low-laid—
      That this dead wall should be
   Betwixt the Maker and the made,
      Between Thyself and me!

   For, say one puts a child to nurse,
      He eyes it now and then
   To know if better ’tis, or worse,
      And if it mourn, and when.

   But Thou, Lord, giv’st us men our clay
      In helpless bondage thus
   To Time and Chance, and seem’st straightway
      To think no more of us!

   That some disaster cleft Thy scheme
      And tore us wide apart,
   So that no cry can cross, I deem;
      For Thou art mild of heart,

   And would’st not shape and shut us in
      Where voice can not he heard:
   ’Tis plain Thou meant’st that we should win
      Thy succour by a word.

   Might but Thy sense flash down the skies
      Like man’s from clime to clime,
   Thou would’st not let me agonize
      Through my remaining time;

   But, seeing how much Thy creatures bear—
      Lame, starved, or maimed, or blind—
   Thou’dst heal the ills with quickest care
      Of me and all my kind.

   Then, since Thou mak’st not these things be,
      But these things dost not know,
   I’ll praise Thee as were shown to me
      The mercies Thou would’st show!



BY THE EARTH’S CORPSE


                                    I

      “O LORD, why grievest Thou?—
      Since Life has ceased to be
      Upon this globe, now cold
      As lunar land and sea,
   And humankind, and fowl, and fur
      Are gone eternally,
   All is the same to Thee as ere
      They knew mortality.”

                                    II

   “O Time,” replied the Lord,
      “Thou read’st me ill, I ween;
   Were all _the same_, I should not grieve
      At that late earthly scene,
   Now blestly past—though planned by me
      With interest close and keen!—
   Nay, nay: things now are _not_ the same
      As they have earlier been.

                                   III

      “Written indelibly
      On my eternal mind
      Are all the wrongs endured
      By Earth’s poor patient kind,
   Which my too oft unconscious hand
      Let enter undesigned.
   No god can cancel deeds foredone,
      Or thy old coils unwind!

                                    IV

      “As when, in Noë’s days,
      I whelmed the plains with sea,
      So at this last, when flesh
      And herb but fossils be,
   And, all extinct, their piteous dust
      Revolves obliviously,
   That I made Earth, and life, and man,
      It still repenteth me!”



MUTE OPINION


                                    I

   I TRAVERSED a dominion
   Whose spokesmen spake out strong
   Their purpose and opinion
   Through pulpit, press, and song.
   I scarce had means to note there
   A large-eyed few, and dumb,
   Who thought not as those thought there
   That stirred the heat and hum.

                                    II

   When, grown a Shade, beholding
   That land in lifetime trode,
   To learn if its unfolding
   Fulfilled its clamoured code,
   I saw, in web unbroken,
   Its history outwrought
   Not as the loud had spoken,
   But as the mute had thought.



TO AN UNBORN PAUPER CHILD


                                    I

      BREATHE not, hid Heart: cease silently,
      And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
         Sleep the long sleep:
         The Doomsters heap
      Travails and teens around us here,
   And Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

                                    II

      Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,
      And laughters fail, and greetings die:
         Hopes dwindle; yea,
         Faiths waste away,
      Affections and enthusiasms numb;
   Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

                                   III

      Had I the ear of wombèd souls
      Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
         And thou wert free
         To cease, or be,
      Then would I tell thee all I know,
   And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so?

                                    IV

      Vain vow!  No hint of mine may hence
      To theeward fly: to thy locked sense
         Explain none can
         Life’s pending plan:
      Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
   Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

                                    V

      Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
      Of earth’s wide wold for thee, where not
         One tear, one qualm,
         Should break the calm.
      But I am weak as thou and bare;
   No man can change the common lot to rare.

                                    VI

      Must come and bide.  And such are we—
      Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary—
         That I can hope
         Health, love, friends, scope
      In full for thee; can dream thou’lt find
   Joys seldom yet attained by humankind!



TO FLOWERS FROM ITALY IN WINTER


   SUNNED in the South, and here to-day;
      —If all organic things
   Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say,
      What are your ponderings?

   How can you stay, nor vanish quite
      From this bleak spot of thorn,
   And birch, and fir, and frozen white
      Expanse of the forlorn?

   Frail luckless exiles hither brought!
      Your dust will not regain
   Old sunny haunts of Classic thought
      When you shall waste and wane;

   But mix with alien earth, be lit
      With frigid Boreal flame,
   And not a sign remain in it
      To tell men whence you came.



ON A FINE MORNING


   WHENCE comes Solace?—Not from seeing
   What is doing, suffering, being,
   Not from noting Life’s conditions,
   Nor from heeding Time’s monitions;
      But in cleaving to the Dream,
      And in gazing at the gleam
      Whereby gray things golden seem.

                                    II

   Thus do I this heyday, holding
   Shadows but as lights unfolding,
   As no specious show this moment
   With its irisèd embowment;
      But as nothing other than
      Part of a benignant plan;
      Proof that earth was made for man.

_February_ 1899.



TO LIZBIE BROWNE


                                    I

   DEAR Lizbie Browne,
   Where are you now?
   In sun, in rain?—
   Or is your brow
   Past joy, past pain,
   Dear Lizbie Browne?

                                    II

   Sweet Lizbie Browne
   How you could smile,
   How you could sing!—
   How archly wile
   In glance-giving,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne!

                                   III

   And, Lizbie Browne,
   Who else had hair
   Bay-red as yours,
   Or flesh so fair
   Bred out of doors,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne?

                                    IV

   When, Lizbie Browne,
   You had just begun
   To be endeared
   By stealth to one,
   You disappeared
   My Lizbie Browne!

                                    V

   Ay, Lizbie Browne,
   So swift your life,
   And mine so slow,
   You were a wife
   Ere I could show
   Love, Lizbie Browne.

                                    VI

   Still, Lizbie Browne,
   You won, they said,
   The best of men
   When you were wed . . .
   Where went you then,
   O Lizbie Browne?

                                   VII

   Dear Lizbie Browne,
   I should have thought,
   “Girls ripen fast,”
   And coaxed and caught
   You ere you passed,
   Dear Lizbie Browne!

                                   VIII

   But, Lizbie Browne,
   I let you slip;
   Shaped not a sign;
   Touched never your lip
   With lip of mine,
   Lost Lizbie Browne!

                                    IX

   So, Lizbie Browne,
   When on a day
   Men speak of me
   As not, you’ll say,
   “And who was he?”—
   Yes, Lizbie Browne!



SONG OF HOPE


   O SWEET To-morrow!—
      After to-day
      There will away
   This sense of sorrow.
   Then let us borrow
   Hope, for a gleaming
   Soon will be streaming,
      Dimmed by no gray—
         No gray!

   While the winds wing us
      Sighs from The Gone,
      Nearer to dawn
   Minute-beats bring us;
   When there will sing us
   Larks of a glory
   Waiting our story
      Further anon—
         Anon!

   Doff the black token,
      Don the red shoon,
      Right and retune
   Viol-strings broken;
   Null the words spoken
   In speeches of rueing,
   The night cloud is hueing,
      To-morrow shines soon—
         Shines soon!



THE WELL-BELOVED


   I wayed by star and planet shine
      Towards the dear one’s home
   At Kingsbere, there to make her mine
      When the next sun upclomb.

   I edged the ancient hill and wood
      Beside the Ikling Way,
   Nigh where the Pagan temple stood
      In the world’s earlier day.

   And as I quick and quicker walked
      On gravel and on green,
   I sang to sky, and tree, or talked
      Of her I called my queen.

   —“O faultless is her dainty form,
      And luminous her mind;
   She is the God-created norm
      Of perfect womankind!”

   A shape whereon one star-blink gleamed
      Glode softly by my side,
   A woman’s; and her motion seemed
      The motion of my bride.

   And yet methought she’d drawn erstwhile
      Adown the ancient leaze,
   Where once were pile and peristyle
      For men’s idolatries.

   —“O maiden lithe and lone, what may
      Thy name and lineage be,
   Who so resemblest by this ray
      My darling?—Art thou she?”

   The Shape: “Thy bride remains within
      Her father’s grange and grove.”
   —“Thou speakest rightly,” I broke in,
      “Thou art not she I love.”

   —“Nay: though thy bride remains inside
      Her father’s walls,” said she,
   “The one most dear is with thee here,
      For thou dost love but me.”

   Then I: “But she, my only choice,
      Is now at Kingsbere Grove?”
   Again her soft mysterious voice:
      “I am thy only Love.”

   Thus still she vouched, and still I said,
      “O sprite, that cannot be!” . . .
   It was as if my bosom bled,
      So much she troubled me.

   The sprite resumed: “Thou hast transferred
      To her dull form awhile
   My beauty, fame, and deed, and word,
      My gestures and my smile.

   “O fatuous man, this truth infer,
      Brides are not what they seem;
   Thou lovest what thou dreamest her;
      I am thy very dream!”

   —“O then,” I answered miserably,
      Speaking as scarce I knew,
   “My loved one, I must wed with thee
      If what thou say’st be true!”

   She, proudly, thinning in the gloom:
      “Though, since troth-plight began,
   I’ve ever stood as bride to groom,
      I wed no mortal man!”

   Thereat she vanished by the Cross
      That, entering Kingsbere town,
   The two long lanes form, near the fosse
      Below the faneless Down.

   —When I arrived and met my bride,
      Her look was pinched and thin,
   As if her soul had shrunk and died,
      And left a waste within.



HER REPROACH


   CON the dead page as ’twere live love: press on!
   Cold wisdom’s words will ease thy track for thee;
   Aye, go; cast off sweet ways, and leave me wan
   To biting blasts that are intent on me.

   But if thy object Fame’s far summits be,
   Whose inclines many a skeleton o’erlies
   That missed both dream and substance, stop and see
   How absence wears these cheeks and dims these eyes!

   It surely is far sweeter and more wise
   To water love, than toil to leave anon
   A name whose glory-gleam will but advise
   Invidious minds to quench it with their own,

   And over which the kindliest will but stay
   A moment, musing, “He, too, had his day!”

WESTBOURNE PARK VILLAS,
         1867.



THE INCONSISTENT


   I SAY, “She was as good as fair,”
      When standing by her mound;
   “Such passing sweetness,” I declare,
      “No longer treads the ground.”
   I say, “What living Love can catch
      Her bloom and bonhomie,
   And what in newer maidens match
      Her olden warmth to me!”

   —There stands within yon vestry-nook
      Where bonded lovers sign,
   Her name upon a faded book
      With one that is not mine.
   To him she breathed the tender vow
      She once had breathed to me,
   But yet I say, “O love, even now
      Would I had died for thee!”



A BROKEN APPOINTMENT


         YOU did not come,
   And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.—
   Yet less for loss of your dear presence there
   Than that I thus found lacking in your make
   That high compassion which can overbear
   Reluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sake
   Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,
         You did not come.

         You love not me,
   And love alone can lend you loyalty;
   —I know and knew it.  But, unto the store
   Of human deeds divine in all but name,
   Was it not worth a little hour or more
   To add yet this: Once, you, a woman, came
   To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be
         You love not me?



“BETWEEN US NOW”


   BETWEEN us now and here—
      Two thrown together
   Who are not wont to wear
      Life’s flushest feather—
   Who see the scenes slide past,
   The daytimes dimming fast,
   Let there be truth at last,
      Even if despair.

   So thoroughly and long
      Have you now known me,
   So real in faith and strong
      Have I now shown me,
   That nothing needs disguise
   Further in any wise,
   Or asks or justifies
      A guarded tongue.

   Face unto face, then, say,
      Eyes mine own meeting,
   Is your heart far away,
      Or with mine beating?
   When false things are brought low,
   And swift things have grown slow,
   Feigning like froth shall go,
      Faith be for aye.



“HOW GREAT MY GRIEF”
(TRIOLET)


   HOW great my grief, my joys how few,
   Since first it was my fate to know thee!
   —Have the slow years not brought to view
   How great my grief, my joys how few,
   Nor memory shaped old times anew,
      Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee
   How great my grief, my joys how few,
      Since first it was my fate to know thee?



“I NEED NOT GO”


   I NEED not go
   Through sleet and snow
   To where I know
   She waits for me;
   She will wait me there
   Till I find it fair,
   And have time to spare
   From company.

   When I’ve overgot
   The world somewhat,
   When things cost not
   Such stress and strain,
   Is soon enough
   By cypress sough
   To tell my Love
   I am come again.

   And if some day,
   When none cries nay,
   I still delay
   To seek her side,
   (Though ample measure
   Of fitting leisure
   Await my pleasure)
   She will riot chide.

   What—not upbraid me
   That I delayed me,
   Nor ask what stayed me
   So long?  Ah, no!—
   New cares may claim me,
   New loves inflame me,
   She will not blame me,
   But suffer it so.



THE COQUETTE, AND AFTER
(TRIOLETS)


                                    I

   FOR long the cruel wish I knew
   That your free heart should ache for me
   While mine should bear no ache for you;
   For, long—the cruel wish!—I knew
   How men can feel, and craved to view
   My triumph—fated not to be
   For long! . . . The cruel wish I knew
   That your free heart should ache for me!

                                    II

   At last one pays the penalty—
   The woman—women always do.
   My farce, I found, was tragedy
   At last!—One pays the penalty
   With interest when one, fancy-free,
   Learns love, learns shame . . . Of sinners two
   At last _one_ pays the penalty—
   The woman—women always do!



A SPOT


      IN years defaced and lost,
      Two sat here, transport-tossed,
      Lit by a living love
   The wilted world knew nothing of:
         Scared momently
         By gaingivings,
         Then hoping things
         That could not be.

      Of love and us no trace
      Abides upon the place;
      The sun and shadows wheel,
   Season and season sereward steal;
         Foul days and fair
         Here, too, prevail,
         And gust and gale
         As everywhere.

      But lonely shepherd souls
      Who bask amid these knolls
      May catch a faery sound
   On sleepy noontides from the ground:
         “O not again
         Till Earth outwears
         Shall love like theirs
         Suffuse this glen!”



LONG PLIGHTED


         IS it worth while, dear, now,
   To call for bells, and sally forth arrayed
   For marriage-rites—discussed, decried, delayed
            So many years?

         Is it worth while, dear, now,
   To stir desire for old fond purposings,
   By feints that Time still serves for dallyings,
            Though quittance nears?

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   The day being so far spent, so low the sun,
   The undone thing will soon be as the done,
         And smiles as tears?

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   Our cheeks are worn, our early brown is gray;
   When, meet or part we, none says yea or nay,
         Or heeds, or cares?

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   We still can climb old Yell’ham’s wooded mounds
   Together, as each season steals its rounds
         And disappears?

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   As mates in Mellstock churchyard we can lie,
   Till the last crash of all things low and high
         Shall end the spheres?



THE WIDOW


   BY Mellstock Lodge and Avenue
      Towards her door I went,
   And sunset on her window-panes
      Reflected our intent.

   The creeper on the gable nigh
      Was fired to more than red
   And when I came to halt thereby
      “Bright as my joy!” I said.

   Of late days it had been her aim
      To meet me in the hall;
   Now at my footsteps no one came;
      And no one to my call.

   Again I knocked; and tardily
      An inner step was heard,
   And I was shown her presence then
      With scarce an answering word.

   She met me, and but barely took
      My proffered warm embrace;
   Preoccupation weighed her look,
      And hardened her sweet face.

   “To-morrow—could you—would you call?
      Make brief your present stay?
   My child is ill—my one, my all!—
      And can’t be left to-day.”

   And then she turns, and gives commands
      As I were out of sound,
   Or were no more to her and hers
      Than any neighbour round . . .

   —As maid I wooed her; but one came
      And coaxed her heart away,
   And when in time he wedded her
      I deemed her gone for aye.

   He won, I lost her; and my loss
      I bore I know not how;
   But I do think I suffered then
      Less wretchedness than now.

   For Time, in taking him, had oped
      An unexpected door
   Of bliss for me, which grew to seem
      Far surer than before . . .

   Her word is steadfast, and I know
      That plighted firm are we:
   But she has caught new love-calls since
      She smiled as maid on me!



AT A HASTY WEDDING
(TRIOLET)


   IF hours be years the twain are blest,
   For now they solace swift desire
   By bonds of every bond the best,
   If hours be years.  The twain are blest
   Do eastern stars slope never west,
   Nor pallid ashes follow fire:
   If hours be years the twain are blest,
   For now they solace swift desire.



THE DREAM-FOLLOWER


   A DREAM of mine flew over the mead
      To the halls where my old Love reigns;
   And it drew me on to follow its lead:
      And I stood at her window-panes;

   And I saw but a thing of flesh and bone
      Speeding on to its cleft in the clay;
   And my dream was scared, and expired on a moan,
      And I whitely hastened away.



HIS IMMORTALITY


                                    I

      I SAW a dead man’s finer part
   Shining within each faithful heart
   Of those bereft.  Then said I: “This must be
         His immortality.”

                                    II

      I looked there as the seasons wore,
   And still his soul continuously upbore
   Its life in theirs.  But less its shine excelled
         Than when I first beheld.

                                   III

      His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then
   In later hearts I looked for him again;
   And found him—shrunk, alas! into a thin
         And spectral mannikin.

                                    IV

      Lastly I ask—now old and chill—
   If aught of him remain unperished still;
   And find, in me alone, a feeble spark,
         Dying amid the dark.

_February_ 1899.



THE TO-BE-FORGOTTEN


                                    I

      I HEARD a small sad sound,
   And stood awhile amid the tombs around:
   “Wherefore, old friends,” said I, “are ye distrest,
      Now, screened from life’s unrest?”

                                    II

      —“O not at being here;
   But that our future second death is drear;
   When, with the living, memory of us numbs,
      And blank oblivion comes!

                                   III

      “Those who our grandsires be
   Lie here embraced by deeper death than we;
   Nor shape nor thought of theirs canst thou descry
      With keenest backward eye.

                                    IV

      “They bide as quite forgot;
   They are as men who have existed not;
   Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful breath;
      It is the second death.

                                    V

      “We here, as yet, each day
   Are blest with dear recall; as yet, alway
   In some soul hold a loved continuance
      Of shape and voice and glance.

                                    VI

      “But what has been will be—
   First memory, then oblivion’s turbid sea;
   Like men foregone, shall we merge into those
      Whose story no one knows.

                                   VII

      “For which of us could hope
   To show in life that world-awakening scope
   Granted the few whose memory none lets die,
      But all men magnify?

                                   VIII

      “We were but Fortune’s sport;
   Things true, things lovely, things of good report
   We neither shunned nor sought . . . We see our bourne,
      And seeing it we mourn.”



WIVES IN THE SERE


                                    I

   NEVER a careworn wife but shows,
      If a joy suffuse her,
   Something beautiful to those
      Patient to peruse her,
   Some one charm the world unknows
      Precious to a muser,
   Haply what, ere years were foes,
      Moved her mate to choose her.

                                    II

   But, be it a hint of rose
      That an instant hues her,
   Or some early light or pose
      Wherewith thought renews her—
   Seen by him at full, ere woes
      Practised to abuse her—
   Sparely comes it, swiftly goes,
      Time again subdues her.



THE SUPERSEDED


                                    I

   AS newer comers crowd the fore,
      We drop behind.
   —We who have laboured long and sore
      Times out of mind,
   And keen are yet, must not regret
      To drop behind.

                                    II

   Yet there are of us some who grieve
      To go behind;
   Staunch, strenuous souls who scarce believe
      Their fires declined,
   And know none cares, remembers, spares
      Who go behind.

                                   III

   ’Tis not that we have unforetold
      The drop behind;
   We feel the new must oust the old
      In every kind;
   But yet we think, must we, must _we_,
      Too, drop behind?



AN AUGUST MIDNIGHT


                                    I

   A SHADED lamp and a waving blind,
   And the beat of a clock from a distant floor:
   On this scene enter—winged, horned, and spined—
   A longlegs, a moth, and a dumbledore;
   While ’mid my page there idly stands
   A sleepy fly, that rubs its hands . . .

                                    II

   Thus meet we five, in this still place,
   At this point of time, at this point in space.
   —My guests parade my new-penned ink,
   Or bang at the lamp-glass, whirl, and sink.
   “God’s humblest, they!” I muse.  Yet why?
   They know Earth-secrets that know not I.

MAX GATE, 1899.



THE CAGED THRUSH FREED AND HOME AGAIN
(VILLANELLE)


   “MEN know but little more than we,
   Who count us least of things terrene,
   How happy days are made to be!

   “Of such strange tidings what think ye,
   O birds in brown that peck and preen?
   Men know but little more than we!

   “When I was borne from yonder tree
   In bonds to them, I hoped to glean
   How happy days are made to be,

   “And want and wailing turned to glee;
   Alas, despite their mighty mien
   Men know but little more than we!

   “They cannot change the Frost’s decree,
   They cannot keep the skies serene;
   How happy days are made to be

   “Eludes great Man’s sagacity
   No less than ours, O tribes in treen!
   Men know but little more than we
   How happy days are made to be.”



BIRDS AT WINTER NIGHTFALL
(TRIOLET)


   AROUND the house the flakes fly faster,
   And all the berries now are gone
   From holly and cotoneaster
   Around the house.  The flakes fly!—faster
   Shutting indoors that crumb-outcaster
   We used to see upon the lawn
   Around the house.  The flakes fly faster,
   And all the berries now are gone!

MAX GATE.



THE PUZZLED GAME-BIRDS
(TRIOLET)


   THEY are not those who used to feed us
   When we were young—they cannot be—
   These shapes that now bereave and bleed us?
   They are not those who used to feed us,—
   For would they not fair terms concede us?
   —If hearts can house such treachery
   They are not those who used to feed us
   When we were young—they cannot be!



WINTER IN DURNOVER FIELD


SCENE.—A wide stretch of fallow ground recently sown with wheat, and
frozen to iron hardness.  Three large birds walking about thereon, and
wistfully eyeing the surface.  Wind keen from north-east: sky a dull
grey.

                                (TRIOLET)

   _Rook_.—Throughout the field I find no grain;
      The cruel frost encrusts the cornland!
   _Starling_.—Aye: patient pecking now is vain
      Throughout the field, I find . . .
   _Rook_.—No grain!
   _Pigeon_.—Nor will be, comrade, till it rain,
      Or genial thawings loose the lorn land
      Throughout the field.
   _Rook_.—I find no grain:
      The cruel frost encrusts the cornland!



THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM


   WHY should this flower delay so long
      To show its tremulous plumes?
   Now is the time of plaintive robin-song,
      When flowers are in their tombs.

   Through the slow summer, when the sun
      Called to each frond and whorl
   That all he could for flowers was being done,
      Why did it not uncurl?

   It must have felt that fervid call
      Although it took no heed,
   Waking but now, when leaves like corpses fall,
      And saps all retrocede.

   Too late its beauty, lonely thing,
      The season’s shine is spent,
   Nothing remains for it but shivering
      In tempests turbulent.

   Had it a reason for delay,
      Dreaming in witlessness
   That for a bloom so delicately gay
      Winter would stay its stress?

   —I talk as if the thing were born
      With sense to work its mind;
   Yet it is but one mask of many worn
      By the Great Face behind.



THE DARKLING THRUSH


   I LEANT upon a coppice gate
      When Frost was spectre-gray,
   And Winter’s dregs made desolate
      The weakening eye of day.
   The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
      Like strings from broken lyres,
   And all mankind that haunted nigh
      Had sought their household fires.

   The land’s sharp features seemed to be
      The Century’s corpse outleant,
   His crypt the cloudy canopy,
      The wind his death-lament.
   The ancient pulse of germ and birth
      Was shrunken hard and dry,
   And every spirit upon earth
      Seemed fervourless as I.

   At once a voice outburst among
      The bleak twigs overhead
   In a full-hearted evensong
      Of joy illimited;
   An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
      In blast-beruffled plume,
   Had chosen thus to fling his soul
      Upon the growing gloom.

   So little cause for carollings
      Of such ecstatic sound
   Was written on terrestrial things
      Afar or nigh around,
   That I could think there trembled through
      His happy good-night air
   Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
      And I was unaware.

_December_ 1900.



THE COMET AT YALBURY OR YELL’HAM


                                    I

   IT bends far over Yell’ham Plain,
      And we, from Yell’ham Height,
   Stand and regard its fiery train,
      So soon to swim from sight.

                                    II

   It will return long years hence, when
      As now its strange swift shine
   Will fall on Yell’ham; but not then
      On that sweet form of thine.



MAD JUDY


   WHEN the hamlet hailed a birth
      Judy used to cry:
   When she heard our christening mirth
      She would kneel and sigh.
   She was crazed, we knew, and we
   Humoured her infirmity.

   When the daughters and the sons
      Gathered them to wed,
   And we like-intending ones
      Danced till dawn was red,
   She would rock and mutter, “More
   Comers to this stony shore!”

   When old Headsman Death laid hands
      On a babe or twain,
   She would feast, and by her brands
      Sing her songs again.
   What she liked we let her do,
   Judy was insane, we knew.



A WASTED ILLNESS


         THROUGH vaults of pain,
   Enribbed and wrought with groins of ghastliness,
   I passed, and garish spectres moved my brain
         To dire distress.

         And hammerings,
   And quakes, and shoots, and stifling hotness, blent
   With webby waxing things and waning things
         As on I went.

         “Where lies the end
   To this foul way?” I asked with weakening breath.
   Thereon ahead I saw a door extend—
         The door to death.

         It loomed more clear:
   “At last!” I cried.  “The all-delivering door!”
   And then, I knew not how, it grew less near
         Than theretofore.

         And back slid I
   Along the galleries by which I came,
   And tediously the day returned, and sky,
         And life—the same.

         And all was well:
   Old circumstance resumed its former show,
   And on my head the dews of comfort fell
         As ere my woe.

         I roam anew,
   Scarce conscious of my late distress . . .  And yet
   Those backward steps through pain I cannot view
         Without regret.

         For that dire train
   Of waxing shapes and waning, passed before,
   And those grim aisles, must be traversed again
         To reach that door.



A MAN
(IN MEMORY OF H. OF M.)


                                    I

   IN Casterbridge there stood a noble pile,
   Wrought with pilaster, bay, and balustrade
   In tactful times when shrewd Eliza swayed.—
         On burgher, squire, and clown
   It smiled the long street down for near a mile

                                    II

   But evil days beset that domicile;
   The stately beauties of its roof and wall
   Passed into sordid hands.  Condemned to fall
         Were cornice, quoin, and cove,
   And all that art had wove in antique style.

                                   III

   Among the hired dismantlers entered there
   One till the moment of his task untold.
   When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold:
         “Be needy I or no,
   I will not help lay low a house so fair!

                                    IV

   “Hunger is hard.  But since the terms be such—
   No wage, or labour stained with the disgrace
   Of wrecking what our age cannot replace
         To save its tasteless soul—
   I’ll do without your dole.  Life is not much!”

                                    V

   Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went,
   And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise
   To close with one who dared to criticize
         And carp on points of taste:
   To work where they were placed rude men were meant.

                                    VI

   Years whiled.  He aged, sank, sickened, and was not:
   And it was said, “A man intractable
   And curst is gone.”  None sighed to hear his knell,
         None sought his churchyard-place;
   His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot.

                                   VII

   The stones of that fair hall lie far and wide,
   And but a few recall its ancient mould;
   Yet when I pass the spot I long to hold
         As truth what fancy saith:
   “His protest lives where deathless things abide!”



THE DAME OF ATHELHALL


                                    I

   “SOUL!  Shall I see thy face,” she said,
      “In one brief hour?
   And away with thee from a loveless bed
   To a far-off sun, to a vine-wrapt bower,
   And be thine own unseparated,
      And challenge the world’s white glower?”

                                    II

   She quickened her feet, and met him where
      They had predesigned:
   And they clasped, and mounted, and cleft the air
   Upon whirling wheels; till the will to bind
   Her life with his made the moments there
      Efface the years behind.

                                   III

   Miles slid, and the sight of the port upgrew
      As they sped on;
   When slipping its bond the bracelet flew
   From her fondled arm.  Replaced anon,
   Its cameo of the abjured one drew
      Her musings thereupon.

                                    IV

   The gaud with his image once had been
      A gift from him:
   And so it was that its carving keen
   Refurbished memories wearing dim,
   Which set in her soul a throe of teen,
      And a tear on her lashes’ brim.

                                    V

   “I may not go!” she at length upspake,
      “Thoughts call me back—
   I would still lose all for your dear, dear sake;
   My heart is thine, friend!  But my track
   I home to Athelhall must take
      To hinder household wrack!”

                                    VI

   He appealed.  But they parted, weak and wan:
      And he left the shore;
   His ship diminished, was low, was gone;
   And she heard in the waves as the daytide wore,
   And read in the leer of the sun that shone,
      That they parted for evermore.

                                   VII

   She homed as she came, at the dip of eve
      On Athel Coomb
   Regaining the Hall she had sworn to leave . . .
   The house was soundless as a tomb,
   And she entered her chamber, there to grieve
      Lone, kneeling, in the gloom.

                                   VIII

   From the lawn without rose her husband’s voice
      To one his friend:
   “Another her Love, another my choice,
   Her going is good.  Our conditions mend;
   In a change of mates we shall both rejoice;
      I hoped that it thus might end!

                                    IX

   “A quick divorce; she will make him hers,
      And I wed mine.
   So Time rights all things in long, long years—
   Or rather she, by her bold design!
   I admire a woman no balk deters:
      She has blessed my life, in fine.

                                    X

   “I shall build new rooms for my new true bride,
      Let the bygone be:
   By now, no doubt, she has crossed the tide
   With the man to her mind.  Far happier she
   In some warm vineland by his side
      Than ever she was with me.”



THE SEASONS OF HER YEAR


                                    I

   WINTER is white on turf and tree,
      And birds are fled;
   But summer songsters pipe to me,
      And petals spread,
   For what I dreamt of secretly
      His lips have said!

                                    II

   O ’tis a fine May morn, they say,
      And blooms have blown;
   But wild and wintry is my day,
      My birds make moan;
   For he who vowed leaves me to pay
      Alone—alone!



THE MILKMAID


      UNDER a daisied bank
   There stands a rich red ruminating cow,
      And hard against her flank
   A cotton-hooded milkmaid bends her brow.

      The flowery river-ooze
   Upheaves and falls; the milk purrs in the pail;
      Few pilgrims but would choose
   The peace of such a life in such a vale.

      The maid breathes words—to vent,
   It seems, her sense of Nature’s scenery,
      Of whose life, sentiment,
   And essence, very part itself is she.

      She bends a glance of pain,
   And, at a moment, lets escape a tear;
      Is it that passing train,
   Whose alien whirr offends her country ear?—

      Nay!  Phyllis does not dwell
   On visual and familiar things like these;
      What moves her is the spell
   Of inner themes and inner poetries:

      Could but by Sunday morn
   Her gay new gown come, meads might dry to dun,
      Trains shriek till ears were torn,
   If Fred would not prefer that Other One.



THE LEVELLED CHURCHYARD


   “O PASSENGER, pray list and catch
      Our sighs and piteous groans,
   Half stifled in this jumbled patch
      Of wrenched memorial stones!

   “We late-lamented, resting here,
      Are mixed to human jam,
   And each to each exclaims in fear,
      ‘I know not which I am!’

   “The wicked people have annexed
      The verses on the good;
   A roaring drunkard sports the text
      Teetotal Tommy should!

   “Where we are huddled none can trace,
      And if our names remain,
   They pave some path or p-ing place
      Where we have never lain!

   “There’s not a modest maiden elf
      But dreads the final Trumpet,
   Lest half of her should rise herself,
      And half some local strumpet!

   “From restorations of Thy fane,
      From smoothings of Thy sward,
   From zealous Churchmen’s pick and plane
      Deliver us O Lord!  Amen!”

1882.



THE RUINED MAID


   “O ’Melia, my dear, this does everything crown!
   Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town?
   And whence such fair garments, such prosperi-ty?”—
   “O didn’t you know I’d been ruined?” said she.

   —“You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks,
   Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks;
   And now you’ve gay bracelets and bright feathers three!”—
   “Yes: that’s how we dress when we’re ruined,” said she.

   —“At home in the barton you said ‘thee’ and ‘thou,’
   And ‘thik oon,’ and ‘theäs oon,’ and ‘t’other’; but now
   Your talking quite fits ’ee for high compa-ny!”—
   “Some polish is gained with one’s ruin,” said she.

   —“Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak,
   But now I’m bewitched by your delicate cheek,
   And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!”—
   “We never do work when we’re ruined,” said she.

   —“You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
   And you’d sigh, and you’d sock; but at present you seem
   To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!”—
   “True.  There’s an advantage in ruin,” said she.

   —“I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
   And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!”—
   “My dear—a raw country girl, such as you be,
   Isn’t equal to that.  You ain’t ruined,” said she.

WESTBOURNE PARK VILLAS, 1866.



THE RESPECTABLE BURGHER
ON “THE HIGHER CRITICISM”


   SINCE Reverend Doctors now declare
   That clerks and people must prepare
   To doubt if Adam ever were;
   To hold the flood a local scare;
   To argue, though the stolid stare,
   That everything had happened ere
   The prophets to its happening sware;
   That David was no giant-slayer,
   Nor one to call a God-obeyer
   In certain details we could spare,
   But rather was a debonair
   Shrewd bandit, skilled as banjo-player:
   That Solomon sang the fleshly Fair,
   And gave the Church no thought whate’er;
   That Esther with her royal wear,
   And Mordecai, the son of Jair,
   And Joshua’s triumphs, Job’s despair,
   And Balaam’s ass’s bitter blare;
   Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace-flare,
   And Daniel and the den affair,
   And other stories rich and rare,
   Were writ to make old doctrine wear
   Something of a romantic air:
   That the Nain widow’s only heir,
   And Lazarus with cadaverous glare
   (As done in oils by Piombo’s care)
   Did not return from Sheol’s lair:
   That Jael set a fiendish snare,
   That Pontius Pilate acted square,
   That never a sword cut Malchus’ ear
   And (but for shame I must forbear)
   That — — did not reappear! . . .
   —Since thus they hint, nor turn a hair,
   All churchgoing will I forswear,
   And sit on Sundays in my chair,
   And read that moderate man Voltaire.



ARCHITECTURAL MASKS


                                    I

   THERE is a house with ivied walls,
   And mullioned windows worn and old,
   And the long dwellers in those halls
   Have souls that know but sordid calls,
      And daily dote on gold.

                                    II

   In blazing brick and plated show
   Not far away a “villa” gleams,
   And here a family few may know,
   With book and pencil, viol and bow,
      Lead inner lives of dreams.

                                   III

   The philosophic passers say,
   “See that old mansion mossed and fair,
   Poetic souls therein are they:
   And O that gaudy box!  Away,
      You vulgar people there.”



THE TENANT-FOR-LIFE


   THE sun said, watching my watering-pot
      “Some morn you’ll pass away;
   These flowers and plants I parch up hot—
      Who’ll water them that day?

   “Those banks and beds whose shape your eye
      Has planned in line so true,
   New hands will change, unreasoning why
      Such shape seemed best to you.

   “Within your house will strangers sit,
      And wonder how first it came;
   They’ll talk of their schemes for improving it,
      And will not mention your name.

   “They’ll care not how, or when, or at what
      You sighed, laughed, suffered here,
   Though you feel more in an hour of the spot
      Than they will feel in a year

   “As I look on at you here, now,
      Shall I look on at these;
   But as to our old times, avow
      No knowledge—hold my peace! . . .

   “O friend, it matters not, I say;
      Bethink ye, I have shined
   On nobler ones than you, and they
      Are dead men out of mind!”



THE KING’S EXPERIMENT


      IT was a wet wan hour in spring,
   And Nature met King Doom beside a lane,
   Wherein Hodge trudged, all blithely ballading
         The Mother’s smiling reign.

      “Why warbles he that skies are fair
   And coombs alight,” she cried, “and fallows gay,
   When I have placed no sunshine in the air
         Or glow on earth to-day?”

      “’Tis in the comedy of things
   That such should be,” returned the one of Doom;
   “Charge now the scene with brightest blazonings,
         And he shall call them gloom.”

      She gave the word: the sun outbroke,
   All Froomside shone, the hedgebirds raised a song;
   And later Hodge, upon the midday stroke,
         Returned the lane along,

      Low murmuring: “O this bitter scene,
   And thrice accurst horizon hung with gloom!
   How deadly like this sky, these fields, these treen,
         To trappings of the tomb!”

      The Beldame then: “The fool and blind!
   Such mad perverseness who may apprehend?”—
   “Nay; there’s no madness in it; thou shalt find
         Thy law there,” said her friend.

      “When Hodge went forth ’twas to his Love,
   To make her, ere this eve, his wedded prize,
   And Earth, despite the heaviness above,
         Was bright as Paradise.

      “But I sent on my messenger,
   With cunning arrows poisonous and keen,
   To take forthwith her laughing life from her,
         And dull her little een,

      “And white her cheek, and still her breath,
   Ere her too buoyant Hodge had reached her side;
   So, when he came, he clasped her but in death,
         And never as his bride.

      “And there’s the humour, as I said;
   Thy dreary dawn he saw as gleaming gold,
   And in thy glistening green and radiant red
         Funereal gloom and cold.”



THE TREE
AN OLD MAN’S STORY


                                    I

   Its roots are bristling in the air
   Like some mad Earth-god’s spiny hair;
   The loud south-wester’s swell and yell
   Smote it at midnight, and it fell.
      Thus ends the tree
      Where Some One sat with me.

                                    II

   Its boughs, which none but darers trod,
   A child may step on from the sod,
   And twigs that earliest met the dawn
   Are lit the last upon the lawn.
      Cart off the tree
      Beneath whose trunk sat we!

                                   III

   Yes, there we sat: she cooed content,
   And bats ringed round, and daylight went;
   The gnarl, our seat, is wrenched and sunk,
   Prone that queer pocket in the trunk
      Where lay the key
      To her pale mystery.

                                    IV

   “Years back, within this pocket-hole
   I found, my Love, a hurried scrawl
   Meant not for me,” at length said I;
   “I glanced thereat, and let it lie:
      The words were three—
      ‘_Beloved_, _I agree_.’

                                    V

   “Who placed it here; to what request
   It gave assent, I never guessed.
   Some prayer of some hot heart, no doubt,
   To some coy maiden hereabout,
      Just as, maybe,
      With you, Sweet Heart, and me.”

                                    VI

   She waited, till with quickened breath
   She spoke, as one who banisheth
   Reserves that lovecraft heeds so well,
   To ease some mighty wish to tell:
      “’Twas I,” said she,
      “Who wrote thus clinchingly.

                                   VII

   “My lover’s wife—aye, wife!—knew nought
   Of what we felt, and bore, and thought . . .
   He’d said: ‘_I wed with thee or die_:
   _She stands between_, ’_tis true_.  _But why_?
      _Do thou agree_,
      _And—she shalt cease to be_.’

                                   VIII

   “How I held back, how love supreme
   Involved me madly in his scheme
   Why should I say? . . . I wrote assent
   (You found it hid) to his intent . . .
      She—_died_ . . . But he
      Came not to wed with me.

                                    IX

   “O shrink not, Love!—Had these eyes seen
   But once thine own, such had not been!
   But we were strangers . . . Thus the plot
   Cleared passion’s path.—Why came he not
      To wed with me? . . .
      He wived the gibbet-tree.”

                                    X

   —Under that oak of heretofore
   Sat Sweetheart mine with me no more:
   By many a Fiord, and Strom, and Fleuve
   Have I since wandered . . . Soon, for love,
      Distraught went she—
      ’Twas said for love of me.



HER LATE HUSBAND
(KING’S-HINTOCK, 182–.)


   “No—not where I shall make my own;
      But dig his grave just by
   The woman’s with the initialed stone—
      As near as he can lie—
   After whose death he seemed to ail,
      Though none considered why.

   “And when I also claim a nook,
      And your feet tread me in,
   Bestow me, under my old name,
      Among my kith and kin,
   That strangers gazing may not dream
      I did a husband win.”

   “Widow, your wish shall be obeyed;
      Though, thought I, certainly
   You’d lay him where your folk are laid,
      And your grave, too, will be,
   As custom hath it; you to right,
      And on the left hand he.”

   “Aye, sexton; such the Hintock rule,
      And none has said it nay;
   But now it haps a native here
      Eschews that ancient way . . .
   And it may be, some Christmas night,
      When angels walk, they’ll say:

   “‘O strange interment!  Civilized lands
      Afford few types thereof;
   Here is a man who takes his rest
      Beside his very Love,
   Beside the one who was his wife
      In our sight up above!’”



THE SELF-UNSEEING


   HERE is the ancient floor,
   Footworn and hollowed and thin,
   Here was the former door
   Where the dead feet walked in.

   She sat here in her chair,
   Smiling into the fire;
   He who played stood there,
   Bowing it higher and higher.

   Childlike, I danced in a dream;
   Blessings emblazoned that day
   Everything glowed with a gleam;
   Yet we were looking away!



DE PROFUNDIS


I


    “Percussus sum sicut foenum, et aruit cor meum.”

                                                                 —_Ps._ ci

      WINTERTIME nighs;
   But my bereavement-pain
   It cannot bring again:
      Twice no one dies.

      Flower-petals flee;
   But, since it once hath been,
   No more that severing scene
      Can harrow me.

      Birds faint in dread:
   I shall not lose old strength
   In the lone frost’s black length:
      Strength long since fled!

      Leaves freeze to dun;
   But friends can not turn cold
   This season as of old
      For him with none.

      Tempests may scath;
   But love can not make smart
   Again this year his heart
      Who no heart hath.

      Black is night’s cope;
   But death will not appal
   One who, past doubtings all,
      Waits in unhope.


II


    “Considerabam ad dexteram, et videbam; et non erat qui cognosceret me
    . . . Non est qui requirat animam meam.”—_Ps._ cxli.

   WHEN the clouds’ swoln bosoms echo back the shouts of the many and
   strong
   That things are all as they best may be, save a few to be right ere
   long,
   And my eyes have not the vision in them to discern what to these is so
   clear,
   The blot seems straightway in me alone; one better he were not here.

   The stout upstanders say, All’s well with us: ruers have nought to
   rue!
   And what the potent say so oft, can it fail to be somewhat true?
   Breezily go they, breezily come; their dust smokes around their
   career,
   Till I think I am one horn out of due time, who has no calling here.

   Their dawns bring lusty joys, it seems; their eves exultance sweet;
   Our times are blessed times, they cry: Life shapes it as is most meet,
   And nothing is much the matter; there are many smiles to a tear;
   Then what is the matter is I, I say.  Why should such an one be here?
   . . .

   Let him to whose ears the low-voiced Best seems stilled by the clash
   of the First,
   Who holds that if way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at
   the Worst,
   Who feels that delight is a delicate growth cramped by crookedness,
   custom, and fear,
   Get him up and be gone as one shaped awry; he disturbs the order here.

1895–96.

                                   III

    “Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est!  Habitavi cum
    habitantibus Cedar; multum incola fuit aninia mea.”—_Ps._ cxix.

   THERE have been times when I well might have passed and the ending
   have come—
   Points in my path when the dark might have stolen on me, artless,
   unrueing—
   Ere I had learnt that the world was a welter of futile doing:
   Such had been times when I well might have passed, and the ending have
   come!

   Say, on the noon when the half-sunny hours told that April was nigh,
   And I upgathered and cast forth the snow from the crocus-border,
   Fashioned and furbished the soil into a summer-seeming order,
   Glowing in gladsome faith that I quickened the year thereby.

   Or on that loneliest of eves when afar and benighted we stood,
   She who upheld me and I, in the midmost of Egdon together,
   Confident I in her watching and ward through the blackening heather,
   Deeming her matchless in might and with measureless scope endued.

   Or on that winter-wild night when, reclined by the chimney-nook quoin,
   Slowly a drowse overgat me, the smallest and feeblest of folk there,
   Weak from my baptism of pain; when at times and anon I awoke there—
   Heard of a world wheeling on, with no listing or longing to join.

   Even then! while unweeting that vision could vex or that knowledge
   could numb,
   That sweets to the mouth in the belly are bitter, and tart, and
   untoward,
   Then, on some dim-coloured scene should my briefly raised curtain have
   lowered,
   Then might the Voice that is law have said “Cease!” and the ending
   have come.

1896.



THE CHURCH-BUILDER


                                    I

   THE church flings forth a battled shade
      Over the moon-blanched sward;
   The church; my gift; whereto I paid
      My all in hand and hoard:
         Lavished my gains
         With stintless pains
      To glorify the Lord.

                                    II

   I squared the broad foundations in
      Of ashlared masonry;
   I moulded mullions thick and thin,
      Hewed fillet and ogee;
         I circleted
         Each sculptured head
      With nimb and canopy.

                                   III

   I called in many a craftsmaster
      To fix emblazoned glass,
   To figure Cross and Sepulchre
      On dossal, boss, and brass.
         My gold all spent,
         My jewels went
      To gem the cups of Mass.

                                    IV

   I borrowed deep to carve the screen
      And raise the ivoried Rood;
   I parted with my small demesne
      To make my owings good.
         Heir-looms unpriced
         I sacrificed,
      Until debt-free I stood.

                                    V

   So closed the task.  “Deathless the Creed
      Here substanced!” said my soul:
   “I heard me bidden to this deed,
      And straight obeyed the call.
         Illume this fane,
         That not in vain
      I build it, Lord of all!”

                                    VI

   But, as it chanced me, then and there
      Did dire misfortunes burst;
   My home went waste for lack of care,
      My sons rebelled and curst;
         Till I confessed
         That aims the best
      Were looking like the worst.

                                   VII

   Enkindled by my votive work
      No burning faith I find;
   The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk,
      And give my toil no mind;
         From nod and wink
         I read they think
      That I am fool and blind.

                                   VIII

   My gift to God seems futile, quite;
      The world moves as erstwhile;
   And powerful wrong on feeble right
      Tramples in olden style.
         My faith burns down,
         I see no crown;
      But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile.

                                    IX

   So now, the remedy?  Yea, this:
      I gently swing the door
   Here, of my fane—no soul to wis—
      And cross the patterned floor
         To the rood-screen
         That stands between
      The nave and inner chore.

                                    X

   The rich red windows dim the moon,
      But little light need I;
   I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn
      From woods of rarest dye;
         Then from below
         My garment, so,
      I draw this cord, and tie

                                    XI

   One end thereof around the beam
      Midway ’twixt Cross and truss:
   I noose the nethermost extreme,
      And in ten seconds thus
         I journey hence—
         To that land whence
      No rumour reaches us.

                                   XII

   Well: Here at morn they’ll light on one
      Dangling in mockery
   Of what he spent his substance on
      Blindly and uselessly! . . .
         “He might,” they’ll say,
         “Have built, some way.
      A cheaper gallows-tree!”



THE LOST PYX
A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457}


   SOME say the spot is banned; that the pillar Cross-and-Hand
      Attests to a deed of hell;
   But of else than of bale is the mystic tale
      That ancient Vale-folk tell.

   Ere Cernel’s Abbey ceased hereabout there dwelt a priest,
      (In later life sub-prior
   Of the brotherhood there, whose bones are now bare
      In the field that was Cernel choir).

   One night in his cell at the foot of yon dell
      The priest heard a frequent cry:
   “Go, father, in haste to the cot on the waste,
      And shrive a man waiting to die.”

   Said the priest in a shout to the caller without,
      “The night howls, the tree-trunks bow;
   One may barely by day track so rugged a way,
      And can I then do so now?”

   No further word from the dark was heard,
      And the priest moved never a limb;
   And he slept and dreamed; till a Visage seemed
      To frown from Heaven at him.

   In a sweat he arose; and the storm shrieked shrill,
      And smote as in savage joy;
   While High-Stoy trees twanged to Bubb-Down Hill,
      And Bubb-Down to High-Stoy.

   There seemed not a holy thing in hail,
      Nor shape of light or love,
   From the Abbey north of Blackmore Vale
      To the Abbey south thereof.

   Yet he plodded thence through the dark immense,
      And with many a stumbling stride
   Through copse and briar climbed nigh and nigher
      To the cot and the sick man’s side.

   When he would have unslung the Vessels uphung
      To his arm in the steep ascent,
   He made loud moan: the Pyx was gone
      Of the Blessed Sacrament.

   Then in dolorous dread he beat his head:
      “No earthly prize or pelf
   Is the thing I’ve lost in tempest tossed,
      But the Body of Christ Himself!”

   He thought of the Visage his dream revealed,
      And turned towards whence he came,
   Hands groping the ground along foot-track and field,
      And head in a heat of shame.

   Till here on the hill, betwixt vill and vill,
      He noted a clear straight ray
   Stretching down from the sky to a spot hard by,
      Which shone with the light of day.

   And gathered around the illumined ground
      Were common beasts and rare,
   All kneeling at gaze, and in pause profound
      Attent on an object there.

   ’Twas the Pyx, unharmed ’mid the circling rows
      Of Blackmore’s hairy throng,
   Whereof were oxen, sheep, and does,
      And hares from the brakes among;

   And badgers grey, and conies keen,
      And squirrels of the tree,
   And many a member seldom seen
      Of Nature’s family.

   The ireful winds that scoured and swept
      Through coppice, clump, and dell,
   Within that holy circle slept
      Calm as in hermit’s cell.

   Then the priest bent likewise to the sod
      And thanked the Lord of Love,
   And Blessed Mary, Mother of God,
      And all the saints above.

   And turning straight with his priceless freight,
      He reached the dying one,
   Whose passing sprite had been stayed for the rite
      Without which bliss hath none.

   And when by grace the priest won place,
      And served the Abbey well,
   He reared this stone to mark where shone
      That midnight miracle.



TESS’S LAMENT


                                    I

   I WOULD that folk forgot me quite,
            Forgot me quite!
   I would that I could shrink from sight,
      And no more see the sun.
   Would it were time to say farewell,
   To claim my nook, to need my knell,
   Time for them all to stand and tell
      Of my day’s work as done.

                                    II

   Ah! dairy where I lived so long,
            I lived so long;
   Where I would rise up stanch and strong,
      And lie down hopefully.
   ’Twas there within the chimney-seat
   He watched me to the clock’s slow beat—
   Loved me, and learnt to call me sweet,
      And whispered words to me.

                                   III

   And now he’s gone; and now he’s gone; . . .
         And now he’s gone!
   The flowers we potted p’rhaps are thrown
      To rot upon the farm.
   And where we had our supper-fire
   May now grow nettle, dock, and briar,
   And all the place be mould and mire
      So cozy once and warm.

                                    IV

   And it was I who did it all,
            Who did it all;
   ’Twas I who made the blow to fall
      On him who thought no guile.
   Well, it is finished—past, and he
   Has left me to my misery,
   And I must take my Cross on me
      For wronging him awhile.

                                    V

   How gay we looked that day we wed,
         That day we wed!
   “May joy be with ye!” all o’m said
      A standing by the durn.
   I wonder what they say o’s now,
   And if they know my lot; and how
   She feels who milks my favourite cow,
      And takes my place at churn!

                                    VI

   It wears me out to think of it,
         To think of it;
   I cannot bear my fate as writ,
      I’d have my life unbe;
   Would turn my memory to a blot,
   Make every relic of me rot,
   My doings be as they were not,
      And what they’ve brought to me!



THE SUPPLANTER
A TALE


                                    I

   HE bends his travel-tarnished feet
      To where she wastes in clay:
   From day-dawn until eve he fares
      Along the wintry way;
   From day-dawn until eve repairs
      Unto her mound to pray.

                                    II

   “Are these the gravestone shapes that meet
      My forward-straining view?
   Or forms that cross a window-blind
      In circle, knot, and queue:
   Gay forms, that cross and whirl and wind
      To music throbbing through?”—

                                   III

   “The Keeper of the Field of Tombs
      Dwells by its gateway-pier;
   He celebrates with feast and dance
      His daughter’s twentieth year:
   He celebrates with wine of France
      The birthday of his dear.”—

                                    IV

   “The gates are shut when evening glooms:
      Lay down your wreath, sad wight;
   To-morrow is a time more fit
      For placing flowers aright:
   The morning is the time for it;
      Come, wake with us to-night!”—

                                    V

   He grounds his wreath, and enters in,
      And sits, and shares their cheer.—
   “I fain would foot with you, young man,
      Before all others here;
   I fain would foot it for a span
      With such a cavalier!”

                                    VI

   She coaxes, clasps, nor fails to win
      His first-unwilling hand:
   The merry music strikes its staves,
      The dancers quickly band;
   And with the damsel of the graves
      He duly takes his stand.

                                   VII

   “You dance divinely, stranger swain,
      Such grace I’ve never known.
   O longer stay!  Breathe not adieu
      And leave me here alone!
   O longer stay: to her be true
      Whose heart is all your own!”—

                                   VIII

   “I mark a phantom through the pane,
      That beckons in despair,
   Its mouth all drawn with heavy moan—
      Her to whom once I sware!”—
   “Nay; ’tis the lately carven stone
      Of some strange girl laid there!”—

                                    IX

   “I see white flowers upon the floor
      Betrodden to a clot;
   My wreath were they?”—“Nay; love me much,
      Swear you’ll forget me not!
   ’Twas but a wreath!  Full many such
      Are brought here and forgot.”

                              * * * * * * *

                                    X

   The watches of the night grow hoar,
      He rises ere the sun;
   “Now could I kill thee here!” he says,
      “For winning me from one
   Who ever in her living days
      Was pure as cloistered nun!”

                                    XI

   She cowers, and he takes his track
      Afar for many a mile,
   For evermore to be apart
      From her who could beguile
   His senses by her burning heart,
      And win his love awhile.

                                   XII

   A year: and he is travelling back
      To her who wastes in clay;
   From day-dawn until eve he fares
      Along the wintry way,
   From day-dawn until eve repairs
      Unto her mound to pray.

                                   XIII

   And there he sets him to fulfil
      His frustrate first intent:
   And lay upon her bed, at last,
      The offering earlier meant:
   When, on his stooping figure, ghast
      And haggard eyes are bent.

                                   XIV

   “O surely for a little while
      You can be kind to me!
   For do you love her, do you hate,
      She knows not—cares not she:
   Only the living feel the weight
      Of loveless misery!

                                    XV

   “I own my sin; I’ve paid its cost,
      Being outcast, shamed, and bare:
   I give you daily my whole heart,
      Your babe my tender care,
   I pour you prayers; and aye to part
      Is more than I can bear!”

                                   XVI

   He turns—unpitying, passion-tossed;
      “I know you not!” he cries,
   “Nor know your child.  I knew this maid,
      But she’s in Paradise!”
   And swiftly in the winter shade
      He breaks from her and flies.




IMITATIONS, ETC.


SAPPHIC FRAGMENT


    “Thou shalt be—Nothing.”—OMAR KHAYYÁM.

    “Tombless, with no remembrance.”—W. SHAKESPEARE.

   DEAD shalt thou lie; and nought
      Be told of thee or thought,
   For thou hast plucked not of the Muses’ tree:
      And even in Hades’ halls
      Amidst thy fellow-thralls
   No friendly shade thy shade shall company!



CATULLUS: XXXI
(After passing Sirmione, April 1887.)


   SIRMIO, thou dearest dear of strands
   That Neptune strokes in lake and sea,
   With what high joy from stranger lands
   Doth thy old friend set foot on thee!
   Yea, barely seems it true to me
   That no Bithynia holds me now,
   But calmly and assuringly
   Around me stretchest homely Thou.

   Is there a scene more sweet than when
   Our clinging cares are undercast,
   And, worn by alien moils and men,
   The long untrodden sill repassed,
   We press the pined for couch at last,
   And find a full repayment there?
   Then hail, sweet Sirmio; thou that wast,
   And art, mine own unrivalled Fair!



AFTER SCHILLER


   KNIGHT, a true sister-love
      This heart retains;
   Ask me no other love,
      That way lie pains!

   Calm must I view thee come,
      Calm see thee go;
   Tale-telling tears of thine
      I must not know!



SONG FROM HEINE


   I SCANNED her picture dreaming,
      Till each dear line and hue
   Was imaged, to my seeming,
      As if it lived anew.

   Her lips began to borrow
      Their former wondrous smile;
   Her fair eyes, faint with sorrow,
      Grew sparkling as erstwhile.

   Such tears as often ran not
      Ran then, my love, for thee;
   And O, believe I cannot
      That thou are lost to me!



FROM VICTOR HUGO


   CHILD, were I king, I’d yield my royal rule,
      My chariot, sceptre, vassal-service due,
   My crown, my porphyry-basined waters cool,
   My fleets, whereto the sea is but a pool,
      For a glance from you!

   Love, were I God, the earth and its heaving airs,
      Angels, the demons abject under me,
   Vast chaos with its teeming womby lairs,
   Time, space, all would I give—aye, upper spheres,
      For a kiss from thee!

RETROSPECT


“I HAVE LIVED WITH SHADES”


                                    I

   I HAVE lived with shades so long,
   And talked to them so oft,
   Since forth from cot and croft
   I went mankind among,
      That sometimes they
      In their dim style
      Will pause awhile
      To hear my say;

                                    II

   And take me by the hand,
   And lead me through their rooms
   In the To-be, where Dooms
   Half-wove and shapeless stand:
      And show from there
      The dwindled dust
      And rot and rust
      Of things that were.

                                   III

   “Now turn,” spake they to me
   One day: “Look whence we came,
   And signify his name
   Who gazes thence at thee.”—
      —“Nor name nor race
      Know I, or can,”
      I said, “Of man
      So commonplace.

                                    IV

   “He moves me not at all;
   I note no ray or jot
   Of rareness in his lot,
   Or star exceptional.
      Into the dim
      Dead throngs around
      He’ll sink, nor sound
      Be left of him.”

                                    V

   “Yet,” said they, “his frail speech,
   Hath accents pitched like thine—
   Thy mould and his define
   A likeness each to each—
      But go!  Deep pain
      Alas, would be
      His name to thee,
      And told in vain!”

_Feb._ 2, 1899.



MEMORY AND I


   “O MEMORY, where is now my youth,
   Who used to say that life was truth?”

   “I saw him in a crumbled cot
      Beneath a tottering tree;
   That he as phantom lingers there
      Is only known to me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my joy,
   Who lived with me in sweet employ?”

   “I saw him in gaunt gardens lone,
      Where laughter used to be;
   That he as phantom wanders there
      Is known to none but me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my hope,
   Who charged with deeds my skill and scope?”

   “I saw her in a tomb of tomes,
      Where dreams are wont to be;
   That she as spectre haunteth there
      Is only known to me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my faith,
   One time a champion, now a wraith?”

   “I saw her in a ravaged aisle,
      Bowed down on bended knee;
   That her poor ghost outflickers there
      Is known to none but me.”

   “O Memory, where is now my love,
   That rayed me as a god above?”

   “I saw him by an ageing shape
      Where beauty used to be;
   That his fond phantom lingers there
      Is only known to me.”



ΑΓΝΩΣΤΩ.  ΘΕΩ.


   LONG have I framed weak phantasies of Thee,
      O Willer masked and dumb!
      Who makest Life become,—
   As though by labouring all-unknowingly,
      Like one whom reveries numb.

   How much of consciousness informs Thy will
      Thy biddings, as if blind,
      Of death-inducing kind,
   Nought shows to us ephemeral ones who fill
      But moments in Thy mind.

   Perhaps Thy ancient rote-restricted ways
      Thy ripening rule transcends;
      That listless effort tends
   To grow percipient with advance of days,
      And with percipience mends.

   For, in unwonted purlieus, far and nigh,
      At whiles or short or long,
      May be discerned a wrong
   Dying as of self-slaughter; whereat I
      Would raise my voice in song.
LYRICS AND REVERIES


IN FRONT OF THE LANDSCAPE


   PLUNGING and labouring on in a tide of visions,
      Dolorous and dear,
   Forward I pushed my way as amid waste waters
      Stretching around,
   Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed landscape
      Yonder and near,

   Blotted to feeble mist.  And the coomb and the upland
      Foliage-crowned,
   Ancient chalk-pit, milestone, rills in the grass-flat
      Stroked by the light,
   Seemed but a ghost-like gauze, and no substantial
      Meadow or mound.

   What were the infinite spectacles bulking foremost
      Under my sight,
   Hindering me to discern my paced advancement
      Lengthening to miles;
   What were the re-creations killing the daytime
      As by the night?

   O they were speechful faces, gazing insistent,
      Some as with smiles,
   Some as with slow-born tears that brinily trundled
      Over the wrecked
   Cheeks that were fair in their flush-time, ash now with anguish,
      Harrowed by wiles.

   Yes, I could see them, feel them, hear them, address them—
      Halo-bedecked—
   And, alas, onwards, shaken by fierce unreason,
      Rigid in hate,
   Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision,
      Dreaded, suspect.

   Then there would breast me shining sights, sweet seasons
      Further in date;
   Instruments of strings with the tenderest passion
      Vibrant, beside
   Lamps long extinguished, robes, cheeks, eyes with the earth’s crust
      Now corporate.

   Also there rose a headland of hoary aspect
      Gnawed by the tide,
   Frilled by the nimb of the morning as two friends stood there
      Guilelessly glad—
   Wherefore they knew not—touched by the fringe of an ecstasy
      Scantly descried.

   Later images too did the day unfurl me,
      Shadowed and sad,
   Clay cadavers of those who had shared in the dramas,
      Laid now at ease,
   Passions all spent, chiefest the one of the broad brow
      Sepulture-clad.

   So did beset me scenes miscalled of the bygone,
      Over the leaze,
   Past the clump, and down to where lay the beheld ones;
      —Yea, as the rhyme
   Sung by the sea-swell, so in their pleading dumbness
      Captured me these.

   For, their lost revisiting manifestations
      In their own time
   Much had I slighted, caring not for their purport,
      Seeing behind
   Things more coveted, reckoned the better worth calling
      Sweet, sad, sublime.

   Thus do they now show hourly before the intenser
      Stare of the mind
   As they were ghosts avenging their slights by my bypast
      Body-borne eyes,
   Show, too, with fuller translation than rested upon them
      As living kind.

   Hence wag the tongues of the passing people, saying
      In their surmise,
   “Ah—whose is this dull form that perambulates, seeing nought
      Round him that looms
   Whithersoever his footsteps turn in his farings,
      Save a few tombs?”



CHANNEL FIRING


   THAT night your great guns, unawares,
   Shook all our coffins as we lay,
   And broke the chancel window-squares,
   We thought it was the Judgment-day

   And sat upright.  While drearisome
   Arose the howl of wakened hounds:
   The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,
   The worms drew back into the mounds,

   The glebe cow drooled.  Till God called, “No;
   It’s gunnery practice out at sea
   Just as before you went below;
   The world is as it used to be:

   “All nations striving strong to make
   Red war yet redder.  Mad as hatters
   They do no more for Christés sake
   Than you who are helpless in such matters.

   “That this is not the judgment-hour
   For some of them’s a blessed thing,
   For if it were they’d have to scour
   Hell’s floor for so much threatening . . .

   “Ha, ha.  It will be warmer when
   I blow the trumpet (if indeed
   I ever do; for you are men,
   And rest eternal sorely need).”

   So down we lay again.  “I wonder,
   Will the world ever saner be,”
   Said one, “than when He sent us under
   In our indifferent century!”

   And many a skeleton shook his head.
   “Instead of preaching forty year,”
   My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,
   “I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.”

   Again the guns disturbed the hour,
   Roaring their readiness to avenge,
   As far inland as Stourton Tower,
   And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.

_April_ 1914.



THE CONVERGENCE OF THE TWAIN


                 (_Lines on the loss of the_ “_Titanic_”)

                                    I

      IN a solitude of the sea
      Deep from human vanity,
   And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.

                                    II

      Steel chambers, late the pyres
      Of her salamandrine fires,
   Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.

                                   III

      Over the mirrors meant
      To glass the opulent
   The sea-worm crawls—grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.

                                    IV

      Jewels in joy designed
      To ravish the sensuous mind
   Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.

                                    V

      Dim moon-eyed fishes near
      Gaze at the gilded gear
   And query: “What does this vaingloriousness down here?” . . .

                                    VI

      Well: while was fashioning
      This creature of cleaving wing,
   The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything

                                   VII

      Prepared a sinister mate
      For her—so gaily great—
   A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.

                                   VIII

      And as the smart ship grew
      In stature, grace, and hue,
   In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.

                                    IX

      Alien they seemed to be:
      No mortal eye could see
   The intimate welding of their later history,

                                    X

      Or sign that they were bent
      By paths coincident
   On being anon twin halves of one august event,

                                    XI

      Till the Spinner of the Years
      Said “Now!”  And each one hears,
   And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.



THE GHOST OF THE PAST


   WE two kept house, the Past and I,
      The Past and I;
   I tended while it hovered nigh,
      Leaving me never alone.
   It was a spectral housekeeping
      Where fell no jarring tone,
   As strange, as still a housekeeping
      As ever has been known.

   As daily I went up the stair
      And down the stair,
   I did not mind the Bygone there—
      The Present once to me;
   Its moving meek companionship
      I wished might ever be,
   There was in that companionship
      Something of ecstasy.

   It dwelt with me just as it was,
      Just as it was
   When first its prospects gave me pause
      In wayward wanderings,
   Before the years had torn old troths
      As they tear all sweet things,
   Before gaunt griefs had torn old troths
      And dulled old rapturings.

   And then its form began to fade,
      Began to fade,
   Its gentle echoes faintlier played
      At eves upon my ear
   Than when the autumn’s look embrowned
      The lonely chambers here,
   The autumn’s settling shades embrowned
      Nooks that it haunted near.

   And so with time my vision less,
      Yea, less and less
   Makes of that Past my housemistress,
      It dwindles in my eye;
   It looms a far-off skeleton
      And not a comrade nigh,
   A fitful far-off skeleton
      Dimming as days draw by.



AFTER THE VISIT
(_To F. E. D._)


      COME again to the place
   Where your presence was as a leaf that skims
   Down a drouthy way whose ascent bedims
      The bloom on the farer’s face.

      Come again, with the feet
   That were light on the green as a thistledown ball,
   And those mute ministrations to one and to all
      Beyond a man’s saying sweet.

      Until then the faint scent
   Of the bordering flowers swam unheeded away,
   And I marked not the charm in the changes of day
      As the cloud-colours came and went.

      Through the dark corridors
   Your walk was so soundless I did not know
   Your form from a phantom’s of long ago
      Said to pass on the ancient floors,

      Till you drew from the shade,
   And I saw the large luminous living eyes
   Regard me in fixed inquiring-wise
      As those of a soul that weighed,

      Scarce consciously,
   The eternal question of what Life was,
   And why we were there, and by whose strange laws
      That which mattered most could not be.



TO MEET, OR OTHERWISE


   WHETHER to sally and see thee, girl of my dreams,
      Or whether to stay
   And see thee not!  How vast the difference seems
      Of Yea from Nay
   Just now.  Yet this same sun will slant its beams
      At no far day
   On our two mounds, and then what will the difference weigh!

   Yet I will see thee, maiden dear, and make
      The most I can
   Of what remains to us amid this brake Cimmerian
   Through which we grope, and from whose thorns we ache,
      While still we scan
   Round our frail faltering progress for some path or plan.

   By briefest meeting something sure is won;
      It will have been:
   Nor God nor Daemon can undo the done,
      Unsight the seen,
   Make muted music be as unbegun,
      Though things terrene
   Groan in their bondage till oblivion supervene.

   So, to the one long-sweeping symphony
      From times remote
   Till now, of human tenderness, shall we
      Supply one note,
   Small and untraced, yet that will ever be
      Somewhere afloat
   Amid the spheres, as part of sick Life’s antidote.



THE DIFFERENCE


                                    I

   SINKING down by the gate I discern the thin moon,
   And a blackbird tries over old airs in the pine,
   But the moon is a sorry one, sad the bird’s tune,
   For this spot is unknown to that Heartmate of mine.

                                    II

   Did my Heartmate but haunt here at times such as now,
   The song would be joyous and cheerful the moon;
   But she will see never this gate, path, or bough,
   Nor I find a joy in the scene or the tune.



THE SUN ON THE BOOKCASE
(_Student’s Love-song_)


   ONCE more the cauldron of the sun
   Smears the bookcase with winy red,
   And here my page is, and there my bed,
   And the apple-tree shadows travel along.
   Soon their intangible track will be run,
      And dusk grow strong
      And they be fled.

   Yes: now the boiling ball is gone,
   And I have wasted another day . . .
   But wasted—_wasted_, do I say?
   Is it a waste to have imaged one
   Beyond the hills there, who, anon,
      My great deeds done
      Will be mine alway?



“WHEN I SET OUT FOR LYONNESSE”


   WHEN I set out for Lyonnesse,
      A hundred miles away,
      The rime was on the spray,
   And starlight lit my lonesomeness
   When I set out for Lyonnesse
      A hundred miles away.

   What would bechance at Lyonnesse
      While I should sojourn there
      No prophet durst declare,
   Nor did the wisest wizard guess
   What would bechance at Lyonnesse
      While I should sojourn there.

   When I came back from Lyonnesse
      With magic in my eyes,
      None managed to surmise
   What meant my godlike gloriousness,
   When I came back from Lyonnesse
      With magic in my eyes.



A THUNDERSTORM IN TOWN
(_A Reminiscence_)


   SHE wore a new “terra-cotta” dress,
   And we stayed, because of the pelting storm,
   Within the hansom’s dry recess,
   Though the horse had stopped; yea, motionless
      We sat on, snug and warm.

   Then the downpour ceased, to my sharp sad pain,
   And the glass that had screened our forms before
   Flew up, and out she sprang to her door:
   I should have kissed her if the rain
      Had lasted a minute more.



THE TORN LETTER


                                    I

   I tore your letter into strips
      No bigger than the airy feathers
      That ducks preen out in changing weathers
   Upon the shifting ripple-tips.

                                    II

   In darkness on my bed alone
      I seemed to see you in a vision,
      And hear you say: “Why this derision
   Of one drawn to you, though unknown?”

                                   III

   Yes, eve’s quick mood had run its course,
      The night had cooled my hasty madness;
      I suffered a regretful sadness
   Which deepened into real remorse.

                                    IV

   I thought what pensive patient days
      A soul must know of grain so tender,
      How much of good must grace the sender
   Of such sweet words in such bright phrase.

                                    V

   Uprising then, as things unpriced
      I sought each fragment, patched and mended;
      The midnight whitened ere I had ended
   And gathered words I had sacrificed.

                                    VI

   But some, alas, of those I threw
      Were past my search, destroyed for ever:
      They were your name and place; and never
   Did I regain those clues to you.

                                   VII

   I learnt I had missed, by rash unheed,
      My track; that, so the Will decided,
      In life, death, we should be divided,
   And at the sense I ached indeed.

                                   VIII

   That ache for you, born long ago,
      Throbs on; I never could outgrow it.
      What a revenge, did you but know it!
   But that, thank God, you do not know.



BEYOND THE LAST LAMP
(Near Tooting Common)


                                    I

   WHILE rain, with eve in partnership,
   Descended darkly, drip, drip, drip,
   Beyond the last lone lamp I passed
      Walking slowly, whispering sadly,
      Two linked loiterers, wan, downcast:
   Some heavy thought constrained each face,
   And blinded them to time and place.

                                    II

   The pair seemed lovers, yet absorbed
   In mental scenes no longer orbed
   By love’s young rays.  Each countenance
      As it slowly, as it sadly
      Caught the lamplight’s yellow glance
   Held in suspense a misery
   At things which had been or might be.

                                   III

   When I retrod that watery way
   Some hours beyond the droop of day,
   Still I found pacing there the twain
      Just as slowly, just as sadly,
      Heedless of the night and rain.
   One could but wonder who they were
   And what wild woe detained them there.

                                    IV

   Though thirty years of blur and blot
   Have slid since I beheld that spot,
   And saw in curious converse there
      Moving slowly, moving sadly
      That mysterious tragic pair,
   Its olden look may linger on—
   All but the couple; they have gone.

                                    V

   Whither?  Who knows, indeed . . . And yet
   To me, when nights are weird and wet,
   Without those comrades there at tryst
      Creeping slowly, creeping sadly,
      That lone lane does not exist.
   There they seem brooding on their pain,
   And will, while such a lane remain.



THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT


      IF ever joy leave
   An abiding sting of sorrow,
   So befell it on the morrow
      Of that May eve . . .

      The travelled sun dropped
   To the north-west, low and lower,
   The pony’s trot grew slower,
      And then we stopped.

      “This cosy house just by
   I must call at for a minute,
   A sick man lies within it
      Who soon will die.

      “He wished to marry me,
   So I am bound, when I drive near him,
   To inquire, if but to cheer him,
      How he may be.”

      A message was sent in,
   And wordlessly we waited,
   Till some one came and stated
      The bulletin.

      And that the sufferer said,
   For her call no words could thank her;
   As his angel he must rank her
      Till life’s spark fled.

      Slowly we drove away,
   When I turned my head, although not
   Called; why so I turned I know not
      Even to this day.

      And lo, there in my view
   Pressed against an upper lattice
   Was a white face, gazing at us
      As we withdrew.

      And well did I divine
   It to be the man’s there dying,
   Who but lately had been sighing
      For her pledged mine.

      Then I deigned a deed of hell;
   It was done before I knew it;
   What devil made me do it
      I cannot tell!

      Yes, while he gazed above,
   I put my arm about her
   That he might see, nor doubt her
      My plighted Love.

      The pale face vanished quick,
   As if blasted, from the casement,
   And my shame and self-abasement
      Began their prick.

      And they prick on, ceaselessly,
   For that stab in Love’s fierce fashion
   Which, unfired by lover’s passion,
      Was foreign to me.

      She smiled at my caress,
   But why came the soft embowment
   Of her shoulder at that moment
      She did not guess.

      Long long years has he lain
   In thy garth, O sad Saint Cleather:
   What tears there, bared to weather,
      Will cleanse that stain!

      Love is long-suffering, brave,
   Sweet, prompt, precious as a jewel;
   But O, too, Love is cruel,
      Cruel as the grave.



LOST LOVE


   I PLAY my sweet old airs—
      The airs he knew
      When our love was true—
      But he does not balk
      His determined walk,
   And passes up the stairs.

   I sing my songs once more,
      And presently hear
      His footstep near
      As if it would stay;
      But he goes his way,
   And shuts a distant door.

   So I wait for another morn
      And another night
      In this soul-sick blight;
      And I wonder much
      As I sit, why such
   A woman as I was born!



“MY SPIRIT WILL NOT HAUNT THE MOUND”


   MY spirit will not haunt the mound
      Above my breast,
   But travel, memory-possessed,
   To where my tremulous being found
      Life largest, best.

   My phantom-footed shape will go
      When nightfall grays
   Hither and thither along the ways
   I and another used to know
      In backward days.

   And there you’ll find me, if a jot
      You still should care
   For me, and for my curious air;
   If otherwise, then I shall not,
      For you, be there.




WESSEX HEIGHTS (1896)


   THERE are some heights in Wessex, shaped as if by a kindly hand
   For thinking, dreaming, dying on, and at crises when I stand,
   Say, on Ingpen Beacon eastward, or on Wylls-Neck westwardly,
   I seem where I was before my birth, and after death may be.

   In the lowlands I have no comrade, not even the lone man’s friend—
   Her who suffereth long and is kind; accepts what he is too weak to
   mend:
   Down there they are dubious and askance; there nobody thinks as I,
   But mind-chains do not clank where one’s next neighbour is the sky.

   In the towns I am tracked by phantoms having weird detective ways—
   Shadows of beings who fellowed with myself of earlier days:
   They hang about at places, and they say harsh heavy things—
   Men with a frigid sneer, and women with tart disparagings.

   Down there I seem to be false to myself, my simple self that was,
   And is not now, and I see him watching, wondering what crass cause
   Can have merged him into such a strange continuator as this,
   Who yet has something in common with himself, my chrysalis.

   I cannot go to the great grey Plain; there’s a figure against the
   moon,
   Nobody sees it but I, and it makes my breast beat out of tune;
   I cannot go to the tall-spired town, being barred by the forms now
   passed
   For everybody but me, in whose long vision they stand there fast.

   There’s a ghost at Yell’ham Bottom chiding loud at the fall of the
   night,
   There’s a ghost in Froom-side Vale, thin lipped and vague, in a shroud
   of white,
   There is one in the railway-train whenever I do not want it near,
   I see its profile against the pane, saying what I would not hear.

   As for one rare fair woman, I am now but a thought of hers,
   I enter her mind and another thought succeeds me that she prefers;
   Yet my love for her in its fulness she herself even did not know;
   Well, time cures hearts of tenderness, and now I can let her go.

   So I am found on Ingpen Beacon, or on Wylls-Neck to the west,
   Or else on homely Bulbarrow, or little Pilsdon Crest,
   Where men have never cared to haunt, nor women have walked with me,
   And ghosts then keep their distance; and I know some liberty.



IN DEATH DIVIDED


                                    I

      I SHALL rot here, with those whom in their day
         You never knew,
      And alien ones who, ere they chilled to clay,
         Met not my view,
   Will in your distant grave-place ever neighbour you.

                                    II

      No shade of pinnacle or tree or tower,
         While earth endures,
      Will fall on my mound and within the hour
         Steal on to yours;
   One robin never haunt our two green covertures.

                                   III

      Some organ may resound on Sunday noons
         By where you lie,
      Some other thrill the panes with other tunes
         Where moulder I;
   No selfsame chords compose our common lullaby.

                                    IV

      The simply-cut memorial at my head
         Perhaps may take
      A Gothic form, and that above your bed
         Be Greek in make;
   No linking symbol show thereon for our tale’s sake.

                                    V

      And in the monotonous moils of strained, hard-run
         Humanity,
      The eternal tie which binds us twain in one
         No eye will see
   Stretching across the miles that sever you from me.



THE PLACE ON THE MAP


                                    I

      I LOOK upon the map that hangs by me—
   Its shires and towns and rivers lined in varnished artistry—
      And I mark a jutting height
   Coloured purple, with a margin of blue sea.

                                    II

      —’Twas a day of latter summer, hot and dry;
   Ay, even the waves seemed drying as we walked on, she and I,
      By this spot where, calmly quite,
   She informed me what would happen by and by.

                                   III

      This hanging map depicts the coast and place,
   And resuscitates therewith our unexpected troublous case
      All distinctly to my sight,
   And her tension, and the aspect of her face.

                                    IV

      Weeks and weeks we had loved beneath that blazing blue,
   Which had lost the art of raining, as her eyes to-day had too,
      While she told what, as by sleight,
   Shot our firmament with rays of ruddy hue.

                                    V

      For the wonder and the wormwood of the whole
   Was that what in realms of reason would have joyed our double soul
      Wore a torrid tragic light
   Under order-keeping’s rigorous control.

                                    VI

      So, the map revives her words, the spot, the time,
   And the thing we found we had to face before the next year’s prime;
      The charted coast stares bright,
   And its episode comes back in pantomime.



WHERE THE PICNIC WAS


   WHERE we made the fire,
   In the summer time,
   Of branch and briar
   On the hill to the sea
   I slowly climb
   Through winter mire,
   And scan and trace
   The forsaken place
   Quite readily.

   Now a cold wind blows,
   And the grass is gray,
   But the spot still shows
   As a burnt circle—aye,
   And stick-ends, charred,
   Still strew the sward
   Whereon I stand,
   Last relic of the band
   Who came that day!

   Yes, I am here
   Just as last year,
   And the sea breathes brine
   From its strange straight line
   Up hither, the same
   As when we four came.
   —But two have wandered far
   From this grassy rise
   Into urban roar
   Where no picnics are,
   And one—has shut her eyes
   For evermore.



THE SCHRECKHORN
(_With thoughts of Leslie Stephen_)
(June 1897)


   ALOOF, as if a thing of mood and whim;
   Now that its spare and desolate figure gleams
   Upon my nearing vision, less it seems
   A looming Alp-height than a guise of him
   Who scaled its horn with ventured life and limb,
   Drawn on by vague imaginings, maybe,
   Of semblance to his personality
   In its quaint glooms, keen lights, and rugged trim.

   At his last change, when Life’s dull coils unwind,
   Will he, in old love, hitherward escape,
   And the eternal essence of his mind
   Enter this silent adamantine shape,
   And his low voicing haunt its slipping snows
   When dawn that calls the climber dyes them rose?



A SINGER ASLEEP
(_Algernon Charles Swinburne_, 1837–1909)


                                    I

   In this fair niche above the unslumbering sea,
   That sentrys up and down all night, all day,
   From cove to promontory, from ness to bay,
      The Fates have fitly bidden that he should be Pillowed eternally.

                                    II

   —It was as though a garland of red roses
   Had fallen about the hood of some smug nun
   When irresponsibly dropped as from the sun,
   In fulth of numbers freaked with musical closes,
   Upon Victoria’s formal middle time
      His leaves of rhythm and rhyme.

                                   III

   O that far morning of a summer day
   When, down a terraced street whose pavements lay
   Glassing the sunshine into my bent eyes,
   I walked and read with a quick glad surprise
      New words, in classic guise,—

                                    IV

   The passionate pages of his earlier years,
   Fraught with hot sighs, sad laughters, kisses, tears;
   Fresh-fluted notes, yet from a minstrel who
   Blew them not naïvely, but as one who knew
      Full well why thus he blew.

                                    V

   I still can hear the brabble and the roar
   At those thy tunes, O still one, now passed through
   That fitful fire of tongues then entered new!
   Their power is spent like spindrift on this shore;
      Thine swells yet more and more.

                                    VI

   —His singing-mistress verily was no other
   Than she the Lesbian, she the music-mother
   Of all the tribe that feel in melodies;
   Who leapt, love-anguished, from the Leucadian steep
   Into the rambling world-encircling deep
      Which hides her where none sees.

                                   VII

   And one can hold in thought that nightly here
   His phantom may draw down to the water’s brim,
   And hers come up to meet it, as a dim
   Lone shine upon the heaving hydrosphere,
   And mariners wonder as they traverse near,
      Unknowing of her and him.

                                   VIII

   One dreams him sighing to her spectral form:
   “O teacher, where lies hid thy burning line;
   Where are those songs, O poetess divine
   Whose very arts are love incarnadine?”
   And her smile back: “Disciple true and warm,
      Sufficient now are thine.” . . .

                                    IX

   So here, beneath the waking constellations,
   Where the waves peal their everlasting strains,
   And their dull subterrene reverberations
   Shake him when storms make mountains of their plains—
   Him once their peer in sad improvisations,
   And deft as wind to cleave their frothy manes—
   I leave him, while the daylight gleam declines
      Upon the capes and chines.

BONCHURCH, 1910.



A PLAINT TO MAN


   WHEN you slowly emerged from the den of Time,
   And gained percipience as you grew,
   And fleshed you fair out of shapeless slime,

   Wherefore, O Man, did there come to you
   The unhappy need of creating me—
   A form like your own—for praying to?

   My virtue, power, utility,
   Within my maker must all abide,
   Since none in myself can ever be,

   One thin as a shape on a lantern-slide
   Shown forth in the dark upon some dim sheet,
   And by none but its showman vivified.

   “Such a forced device,” you may say, “is meet
   For easing a loaded heart at whiles:
   Man needs to conceive of a mercy-seat

   Somewhere above the gloomy aisles
   Of this wailful world, or he could not bear
   The irk no local hope beguiles.”

   —But since I was framed in your first despair
   The doing without me has had no play
   In the minds of men when shadows scare;

   And now that I dwindle day by day
   Beneath the deicide eyes of seers
   In a light that will not let me stay,

   And to-morrow the whole of me disappears,
   The truth should be told, and the fact be faced
   That had best been faced in earlier years:

   The fact of life with dependence placed
   On the human heart’s resource alone,
   In brotherhood bonded close and graced

   With loving-kindness fully blown,
   And visioned help unsought, unknown.

1909–10.



GOD’S FUNERAL


                                    I

      I saw a slowly-stepping train—
   Lined on the brows, scoop-eyed and bent and hoar—
   Following in files across a twilit plain
   A strange and mystic form the foremost bore.

                                    II

      And by contagious throbs of thought
   Or latent knowledge that within me lay
   And had already stirred me, I was wrought
   To consciousness of sorrow even as they.

                                   III

      The fore-borne shape, to my blurred eyes,
   At first seemed man-like, and anon to change
   To an amorphous cloud of marvellous size,
   At times endowed with wings of glorious range.

                                    IV

      And this phantasmal variousness
   Ever possessed it as they drew along:
   Yet throughout all it symboled none the less
   Potency vast and loving-kindness strong.

                                    V

      Almost before I knew I bent
   Towards the moving columns without a word;
   They, growing in bulk and numbers as they went,
   Struck out sick thoughts that could be overheard:—

                                    VI

      “O man-projected Figure, of late
   Imaged as we, thy knell who shall survive?
   Whence came it we were tempted to create
   One whom we can no longer keep alive?

                                   VII

      “Framing him jealous, fierce, at first,
   We gave him justice as the ages rolled,
   Will to bless those by circumstance accurst,
   And longsuffering, and mercies manifold.

                                   VIII

      “And, tricked by our own early dream
   And need of solace, we grew self-deceived,
   Our making soon our maker did we deem,
   And what we had imagined we believed.

                                    IX

      “Till, in Time’s stayless stealthy swing,
   Uncompromising rude reality
   Mangled the Monarch of our fashioning,
   Who quavered, sank; and now has ceased to be.

                                    X

      “So, toward our myth’s oblivion,
   Darkling, and languid-lipped, we creep and grope
   Sadlier than those who wept in Babylon,
   Whose Zion was a still abiding hope.

                                    XI

      “How sweet it was in years far hied
   To start the wheels of day with trustful prayer,
   To lie down liegely at the eventide
   And feel a blest assurance he was there!

                                   XII

      “And who or what shall fill his place?
   Whither will wanderers turn distracted eyes
   For some fixed star to stimulate their pace
   Towards the goal of their enterprise?” . . .

                                   XIII

      Some in the background then I saw,
   Sweet women, youths, men, all incredulous,
   Who chimed as one: “This figure is of straw,
   This requiem mockery!  Still he lives to us!”

                                   XIV

      I could not prop their faith: and yet
   Many I had known: with all I sympathized;
   And though struck speechless, I did not forget
   That what was mourned for, I, too, once had prized.

                                    XV

      Still, how to bear such loss I deemed
   The insistent question for each animate mind,
   And gazing, to my growing sight there seemed
   A pale yet positive gleam low down behind,

                                   XVI

      Whereof to lift the general night,
   A certain few who stood aloof had said,
   “See you upon the horizon that small light—
   Swelling somewhat?”  Each mourner shook his head.

                                   XVII

      And they composed a crowd of whom
   Some were right good, and many nigh the best . . .
   Thus dazed and puzzled ’twixt the gleam and gloom
   Mechanically I followed with the rest.

1908–10.



SPECTRES THAT GRIEVE


   “IT is not death that harrows us,” they lipped,
   “The soundless cell is in itself relief,
   For life is an unfenced flower, benumbed and nipped
   At unawares, and at its best but brief.”

   The speakers, sundry phantoms of the gone,
   Had risen like filmy flames of phosphor dye,
   As if the palest of sheet lightnings shone
   From the sward near me, as from a nether sky.

   And much surprised was I that, spent and dead,
   They should not, like the many, be at rest,
   But stray as apparitions; hence I said,
   “Why, having slipped life, hark you back distressed?

   “We are among the few death sets not free,
   The hurt, misrepresented names, who come
   At each year’s brink, and cry to History
   To do them justice, or go past them dumb.

   “We are stript of rights; our shames lie unredressed,
   Our deeds in full anatomy are not shown,
   Our words in morsels merely are expressed
   On the scriptured page, our motives blurred, unknown.”

   Then all these shaken slighted visitants sped
   Into the vague, and left me musing there
   On fames that well might instance what they had said,
   Until the New-Year’s dawn strode up the air.



“AH, ARE YOU DIGGING ON MY GRAVE?”


   “AH, are you digging on my grave
      My loved one?—planting rue?”
   —“No: yesterday he went to wed
   One of the brightest wealth has bred.
   ‘It cannot hurt her now,’ he said,
      ‘That I should not be true.’”

   “Then who is digging on my grave?
      My nearest dearest kin?”
   —“Ah, no; they sit and think, ‘What use!
   What good will planting flowers produce?
   No tendance of her mound can loose
      Her spirit from Death’s gin.’”

   “But some one digs upon my grave?
      My enemy?—prodding sly?”
   —“Nay: when she heard you had passed the Gate
   That shuts on all flesh soon or late,
   She thought you no more worth her hate,
      And cares not where you lie.”

   “Then, who is digging on my grave?
      Say—since I have not guessed!”
   —“O it is I, my mistress dear,
   Your little dog, who still lives near,
   And much I hope my movements here
      Have not disturbed your rest?”

   “Ah, yes!  _You_ dig upon my grave . . .
      Why flashed it not on me
   That one true heart was left behind!
   What feeling do we ever find
   To equal among human kind
      A dog’s fidelity!”

   “Mistress, I dug upon your grave
      To bury a bone, in case
   I should be hungry near this spot
   When passing on my daily trot.
   I am sorry, but I quite forgot
      It was your resting-place.”




SATIRES OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IN FIFTEEN GLIMPSES


I
AT TEA


   THE kettle descants in a cozy drone,
   And the young wife looks in her husband’s face,
   And then at her guest’s, and shows in her own
   Her sense that she fills an envied place;
   And the visiting lady is all abloom,
   And says there was never so sweet a room.

   And the happy young housewife does not know
   That the woman beside her was first his choice,
   Till the fates ordained it could not be so . . .
   Betraying nothing in look or voice
   The guest sits smiling and sips her tea,
   And he throws her a stray glance yearningly.



II
IN CHURCH


   “AND now to God the Father,” he ends,
   And his voice thrills up to the topmost tiles:
   Each listener chokes as he bows and bends,
   And emotion pervades the crowded aisles.
   Then the preacher glides to the vestry-door,
   And shuts it, and thinks he is seen no more.

   The door swings softly ajar meanwhile,
   And a pupil of his in the Bible class,
   Who adores him as one without gloss or guile,
   Sees her idol stand with a satisfied smile
   And re-enact at the vestry-glass
   Each pulpit gesture in deft dumb-show
   That had moved the congregation so.



III
BY HER AUNT’S GRAVE


   “SIXPENCE a week,” says the girl to her lover,
   “Aunt used to bring me, for she could confide
   In me alone, she vowed.  ’Twas to cover
   The cost of her headstone when she died.
   And that was a year ago last June;
   I’ve not yet fixed it.  But I must soon.”

   “And where is the money now, my dear?”
   “O, snug in my purse . . . Aunt was _so_ slow
   In saving it—eighty weeks, or near.” . . .
   “Let’s spend it,” he hints.  “For she won’t know.
   There’s a dance to-night at the Load of Hay.”
   She passively nods.  And they go that way.



IV
IN THE ROOM OF THE BRIDE-ELECT


   “WOULD it had been the man of our wish!”
   Sighs her mother.  To whom with vehemence she
   In the wedding-dress—the wife to be—
   “Then why were you so mollyish
   As not to insist on him for me!”
   The mother, amazed: “Why, dearest one,
   Because you pleaded for this or none!”

   “But Father and you should have stood out strong!
   Since then, to my cost, I have lived to find
   That you were right and that I was wrong;
   This man is a dolt to the one declined . . .
   Ah!—here he comes with his button-hole rose.
   Good God—I must marry him I suppose!”



V
AT A WATERING-PLACE


   THEY sit and smoke on the esplanade,
   The man and his friend, and regard the bay
   Where the far chalk cliffs, to the left displayed,
   Smile sallowly in the decline of day.
   And saunterers pass with laugh and jest—
   A handsome couple among the rest.

   “That smart proud pair,” says the man to his friend,
   “Are to marry next week . . . How little he thinks
   That dozens of days and nights on end
   I have stroked her neck, unhooked the links
   Of her sleeve to get at her upper arm . . .
   Well, bliss is in ignorance: what’s the harm!”



VI
IN THE CEMETERY


   “YOU see those mothers squabbling there?”
   Remarks the man of the cemetery.
   One says in tears, ‘’_Tis mine lies here_!’
   Another, ‘_Nay_, _mine_, _you Pharisee_!’
   Another, ‘_How dare you move my flowers_
   _And put your own on this grave of ours_!’
   But all their children were laid therein
   At different times, like sprats in a tin.

   “And then the main drain had to cross,
   And we moved the lot some nights ago,
   And packed them away in the general foss
   With hundreds more.  But their folks don’t know,
   And as well cry over a new-laid drain
   As anything else, to ease your pain!”



VII
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW


   “MY stick!” he says, and turns in the lane
   To the house just left, whence a vixen voice
   Comes out with the firelight through the pane,
   And he sees within that the girl of his choice
   Stands rating her mother with eyes aglare
   For something said while he was there.

   “At last I behold her soul undraped!”
   Thinks the man who had loved her more than himself;
   “My God—’tis but narrowly I have escaped.—
   My precious porcelain proves it delf.”
   His face has reddened like one ashamed,
   And he steals off, leaving his stick unclaimed.



VIII
IN THE STUDY


   HE enters, and mute on the edge of a chair
   Sits a thin-faced lady, a stranger there,
   A type of decayed gentility;
   And by some small signs he well can guess
   That she comes to him almost breakfastless.

   “I have called—I hope I do not err—
   I am looking for a purchaser
   Of some score volumes of the works
   Of eminent divines I own,—
   Left by my father—though it irks
   My patience to offer them.”  And she smiles
   As if necessity were unknown;
   “But the truth of it is that oftenwhiles
   I have wished, as I am fond of art,
   To make my rooms a little smart.”
   And lightly still she laughs to him,
   As if to sell were a mere gay whim,
   And that, to be frank, Life were indeed
   To her not vinegar and gall,
   But fresh and honey-like; and Need
   No household skeleton at all.



IX
AT THE ALTAR-RAIL


   “MY bride is not coming, alas!” says the groom,
   And the telegram shakes in his hand.  “I own
   It was hurried!  We met at a dancing-room
   When I went to the Cattle-Show alone,
   And then, next night, where the Fountain leaps,
   And the Street of the Quarter-Circle sweeps.

   “Ay, she won me to ask her to be my wife—
   ’Twas foolish perhaps!—to forsake the ways
   Of the flaring town for a farmer’s life.
   She agreed.  And we fixed it.  Now she says:
   ‘_It’s sweet of you_, _dear_, _to prepare me a nest_,
   _But a swift_, _short_, _gay life suits me best_.
   _What I really am you have never gleaned_;
   _I had eaten the apple ere you were weaned_.’”



X
IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER


   “O THAT mastering tune?”  And up in the bed
   Like a lace-robed phantom springs the bride;
   “And why?” asks the man she had that day wed,
   With a start, as the band plays on outside.
   “It’s the townsfolks’ cheery compliment
   Because of our marriage, my Innocent.”

   “O but you don’t know!  ’Tis the passionate air
   To which my old Love waltzed with me,
   And I swore as we spun that none should share
   My home, my kisses, till death, save he!
   And he dominates me and thrills me through,
   And it’s he I embrace while embracing you!”



XI
IN THE RESTAURANT


   “BUT hear.  If you stay, and the child be born,
   It will pass as your husband’s with the rest,
   While, if we fly, the teeth of scorn
   Will be gleaming at us from east to west;
   And the child will come as a life despised;
   I feel an elopement is ill-advised!”

   “O you realize not what it is, my dear,
   To a woman!  Daily and hourly alarms
   Lest the truth should out.  How can I stay here,
   And nightly take him into my arms!
   Come to the child no name or fame,
   Let us go, and face it, and bear the shame.”



XII
AT THE DRAPER’S


   “I STOOD at the back of the shop, my dear,
      But you did not perceive me.
   Well, when they deliver what you were shown
      _I_ shall know nothing of it, believe me!”

   And he coughed and coughed as she paled and said,
      “O, I didn’t see you come in there—
   Why couldn’t you speak?”—“Well, I didn’t.  I left
      That you should not notice I’d been there.

   “You were viewing some lovely things.  ‘_Soon required_
      _For a widow_, _of latest fashion_’;
   And I knew ’twould upset you to meet the man
      Who had to be cold and ashen

   “And screwed in a box before they could dress you
      ‘_In the last new note in mourning_,’
   As they defined it.  So, not to distress you,
      I left you to your adorning.”



XIII
ON THE DEATH-BED


   “I’LL tell—being past all praying for—
   Then promptly die . . . He was out at the war,
   And got some scent of the intimacy
   That was under way between her and me;
   And he stole back home, and appeared like a ghost
   One night, at the very time almost
   That I reached her house.  Well, I shot him dead,
   And secretly buried him.  Nothing was said.

   “The news of the battle came next day;
   He was scheduled missing.  I hurried away,
   Got out there, visited the field,
   And sent home word that a search revealed
   He was one of the slain; though, lying alone
   And stript, his body had not been known.

   “But she suspected.  I lost her love,
      Yea, my hope of earth, and of Heaven above;
   And my time’s now come, and I’ll pay the score,
   Though it be burning for evermore.”



XIV
OVER THE COFFIN


   THEY stand confronting, the coffin between,
   His wife of old, and his wife of late,
   And the dead man whose they both had been
   Seems listening aloof, as to things past date.
   —“I have called,” says the first.  “Do you marvel or not?”
   “In truth,” says the second, “I do—somewhat.”

   “Well, there was a word to be said by me! . . .
   I divorced that man because of you—
   It seemed I must do it, boundenly;
   But now I am older, and tell you true,
   For life is little, and dead lies he;
   I would I had let alone you two!
   And both of us, scorning parochial ways,
   Had lived like the wives in the patriarchs’ days.”



XV
IN THE MOONLIGHT


   “O LONELY workman, standing there
   In a dream, why do you stare and stare
   At her grave, as no other grave there were?

   “If your great gaunt eyes so importune
   Her soul by the shine of this corpse-cold moon,
   Maybe you’ll raise her phantom soon!”

   “Why, fool, it is what I would rather see
   Than all the living folk there be;
   But alas, there is no such joy for me!”

   “Ah—she was one you loved, no doubt,
   Through good and evil, through rain and drought,
   And when she passed, all your sun went out?”

   “Nay: she was the woman I did not love,
   Whom all the others were ranked above,
   Whom during her life I thought nothing of.”




LYRICS AND REVERIES
(_continued_)


SELF-UNCONSCIOUS


      ALONG the way
      He walked that day,
   Watching shapes that reveries limn,
      And seldom he
      Had eyes to see
   The moment that encompassed him.

      Bright yellowhammers
      Made mirthful clamours,
   And billed long straws with a bustling air,
      And bearing their load
      Flew up the road
   That he followed, alone, without interest there.

      From bank to ground
      And over and round
   They sidled along the adjoining hedge;
      Sometimes to the gutter
      Their yellow flutter
   Would dip from the nearest slatestone ledge.

      The smooth sea-line
      With a metal shine,
   And flashes of white, and a sail thereon,
      He would also descry
      With a half-wrapt eye
   Between the projects he mused upon.

      Yes, round him were these
      Earth’s artistries,
   But specious plans that came to his call
      Did most engage
      His pilgrimage,
   While himself he did not see at all.

      Dead now as sherds
      Are the yellow birds,
   And all that mattered has passed away;
      Yet God, the Elf,
      Now shows him that self
   As he was, and should have been shown, that day.

      O it would have been good
      Could he then have stood
   At a focussed distance, and conned the whole,
      But now such vision
      Is mere derision,
   Nor soothes his body nor saves his soul.

      Not much, some may
      Incline to say,
   To see therein, had it all been seen.
      Nay! he is aware
      A thing was there
   That loomed with an immortal mien.



THE DISCOVERY


      I WANDERED to a crude coast
         Like a ghost;
      Upon the hills I saw fires—
         Funeral pyres
      Seemingly—and heard breaking
   Waves like distant cannonades that set the land shaking.

      And so I never once guessed
         A Love-nest,
      Bowered and candle-lit, lay
         In my way,
      Till I found a hid hollow,
   Where I burst on her my heart could not but follow.



TOLERANCE


   “IT is a foolish thing,” said I,
   “To bear with such, and pass it by;
   Yet so I do, I know not why!”

   And at each clash I would surmise
   That if I had acted otherwise
   I might have saved me many sighs.

   But now the only happiness
   In looking back that I possess—
   Whose lack would leave me comfortless—

   Is to remember I refrained
   From masteries I might have gained,
   And for my tolerance was disdained;

   For see, a tomb.  And if it were
   I had bent and broke, I should not dare
   To linger in the shadows there.



BEFORE AND AFTER SUMMER


                                    I

   LOOKING forward to the spring
   One puts up with anything.
   On this February day,
   Though the winds leap down the street,
   Wintry scourgings seem but play,
   And these later shafts of sleet
   —Sharper pointed than the first—
   And these later snows—the worst—
   Are as a half-transparent blind
   Riddled by rays from sun behind.

                                    II

   Shadows of the October pine
   Reach into this room of mine:
   On the pine there stands a bird;
   He is shadowed with the tree.
   Mutely perched he bills no word;
   Blank as I am even is he.
   For those happy suns are past,
   Fore-discerned in winter last.
   When went by their pleasure, then?
   I, alas, perceived not when.



AT DAY-CLOSE IN NOVEMBER


   THE ten hours’ light is abating,
      And a late bird flies across,
   Where the pines, like waltzers waiting,
      Give their black heads a toss.

   Beech leaves, that yellow the noon-time,
      Float past like specks in the eye;
   I set every tree in my June time,
      And now they obscure the sky.

   And the children who ramble through here
      Conceive that there never has been
   A time when no tall trees grew here,
      A time when none will be seen.



THE YEAR’S AWAKENING


   HOW do you know that the pilgrim track
   Along the belting zodiac
   Swept by the sun in his seeming rounds
   Is traced by now to the Fishes’ bounds
   And into the Ram, when weeks of cloud
   Have wrapt the sky in a clammy shroud,
   And never as yet a tinct of spring
   Has shown in the Earth’s apparelling;
      O vespering bird, how do you know,
         How do you know?

   How do you know, deep underground,
   Hid in your bed from sight and sound,
   Without a turn in temperature,
   With weather life can scarce endure,
   That light has won a fraction’s strength,
   And day put on some moments’ length,
   Whereof in merest rote will come,
   Weeks hence, mild airs that do not numb;
      O crocus root, how do you know,
         How do you know?

_February_ 1910.



UNDER THE WATERFALL


   “WHENEVER I plunge my arm, like this,
   In a basin of water, I never miss
   The sweet sharp sense of a fugitive day
   Fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray.
      Hence the only prime
      And real love-rhyme
      That I know by heart,
      And that leaves no smart,
   Is the purl of a little valley fall
   About three spans wide and two spans tall
   Over a table of solid rock,
   And into a scoop of the self-same block;
   The purl of a runlet that never ceases
   In stir of kingdoms, in wars, in peaces;
   With a hollow boiling voice it speaks
   And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks.”

   “And why gives this the only prime
   Idea to you of a real love-rhyme?
   And why does plunging your arm in a bowl
   Full of spring water, bring throbs to your soul?”

   “Well, under the fall, in a crease of the stone,
   Though where precisely none ever has known,
   Jammed darkly, nothing to show how prized,
   And by now with its smoothness opalized,
      Is a drinking-glass:
      For, down that pass
      My lover and I
      Walked under a sky
   Of blue with a leaf-woven awning of green,
   In the burn of August, to paint the scene,
   And we placed our basket of fruit and wine
   By the runlet’s rim, where we sat to dine;
   And when we had drunk from the glass together,
   Arched by the oak-copse from the weather,
   I held the vessel to rinse in the fall,
   Where it slipped, and sank, and was past recall,
   Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss
   With long bared arms.  There the glass still is.
   And, as said, if I thrust my arm below
   Cold water in basin or bowl, a throe
   From the past awakens a sense of that time,
   And the glass both used, and the cascade’s rhyme.
   The basin seems the pool, and its edge
   The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge,
   And the leafy pattern of china-ware
   The hanging plants that were bathing there.
   By night, by day, when it shines or lours,
   There lies intact that chalice of ours,
   And its presence adds to the rhyme of love
   Persistently sung by the fall above.
   No lip has touched it since his and mine
   In turns therefrom sipped lovers’ wine.”



THE SPELL OF THE ROSE


      “I MEAN to build a hall anon,
         And shape two turrets there,
         And a broad newelled stair,
   And a cool well for crystal water;
      Yes; I will build a hall anon,
      Plant roses love shall feed upon,
         And apple trees and pear.”

      He set to build the manor-hall,
         And shaped the turrets there,
         And the broad newelled stair,
   And the cool well for crystal water;
      He built for me that manor-hall,
      And planted many trees withal,
         But no rose anywhere.

      And as he planted never a rose
         That bears the flower of love,
         Though other flowers throve
   A frost-wind moved our souls to sever
      Since he had planted never a rose;
      And misconceits raised horrid shows,
         And agonies came thereof.

      “I’ll mend these miseries,” then said I,
         And so, at dead of night,
         I went and, screened from sight,
   That nought should keep our souls in severance,
      I set a rose-bush.  “This,” said I,
      “May end divisions dire and wry,
         And long-drawn days of blight.”

      But I was called from earth—yea, called
         Before my rose-bush grew;
         And would that now I knew
   What feels he of the tree I planted,
      And whether, after I was called
      To be a ghost, he, as of old,
         Gave me his heart anew!

      Perhaps now blooms that queen of trees
         I set but saw not grow,
         And he, beside its glow—
   Eyes couched of the mis-vision that blurred me—
      Ay, there beside that queen of trees
      He sees me as I was, though sees
         Too late to tell me so!



ST. LAUNCE’S REVISITED


      SLIP back, Time!
   Yet again I am nearing
   Castle and keep, uprearing
      Gray, as in my prime.

      At the inn
   Smiling close, why is it
   Not as on my visit
      When hope and I were twin?

      Groom and jade
   Whom I found here, moulder;
   Strange the tavern-holder,
      Strange the tap-maid.

      Here I hired
   Horse and man for bearing
   Me on my wayfaring
      To the door desired.

      Evening gloomed
   As I journeyed forward
   To the faces shoreward,
      Till their dwelling loomed.

      If again
   Towards the Atlantic sea there
   I should speed, they’d be there
      Surely now as then? . . .

      Why waste thought,
   When I know them vanished
   Under earth; yea, banished
      Ever into nought.




POEMS OF 1912–13


                        _Veteris vestigia flammae_



THE GOING


   WHY did you give no hint that night
   That quickly after the morrow’s dawn,
   And calmly, as if indifferent quite,
   You would close your term here, up and be gone
      Where I could not follow
      With wing of swallow
   To gain one glimpse of you ever anon!

      Never to bid good-bye,
      Or give me the softest call,
   Or utter a wish for a word, while I
   Saw morning harden upon the wall,
      Unmoved, unknowing
      That your great going
   Had place that moment, and altered all.

   Why do you make me leave the house
   And think for a breath it is you I see
   At the end of the alley of bending boughs
   Where so often at dusk you used to be;
      Till in darkening dankness
      The yawning blankness
   Of the perspective sickens me!

      You were she who abode
      By those red-veined rocks far West,
   You were the swan-necked one who rode
   Along the beetling Beeny Crest,
      And, reining nigh me,
      Would muse and eye me,
   While Life unrolled us its very best.

   Why, then, latterly did we not speak,
   Did we not think of those days long dead,
   And ere your vanishing strive to seek
   That time’s renewal?  We might have said,
      “In this bright spring weather
      We’ll visit together
   Those places that once we visited.”

      Well, well!  All’s past amend,
      Unchangeable.  It must go.
   I seem but a dead man held on end
   To sink down soon . . . O you could not know
      That such swift fleeing
      No soul foreseeing—
   Not even I—would undo me so!

_December_ 1912.



YOUR LAST DRIVE


   HERE by the moorway you returned,
   And saw the borough lights ahead
   That lit your face—all undiscerned
   To be in a week the face of the dead,
   And you told of the charm of that haloed view
   That never again would beam on you.

   And on your left you passed the spot
   Where eight days later you were to lie,
   And be spoken of as one who was not;
   Beholding it with a cursory eye
   As alien from you, though under its tree
   You soon would halt everlastingly.

   I drove not with you . . . Yet had I sat
   At your side that eve I should not have seen
   That the countenance I was glancing at
   Had a last-time look in the flickering sheen,
   Nor have read the writing upon your face,
   “I go hence soon to my resting-place;

   “You may miss me then.  But I shall not know
   How many times you visit me there,
   Or what your thoughts are, or if you go
   There never at all.  And I shall not care.
   Should you censure me I shall take no heed
   And even your praises I shall not need.”

   True: never you’ll know.  And you will not mind.
   But shall I then slight you because of such?
   Dear ghost, in the past did you ever find
   The thought “What profit?” move me much
   Yet the fact indeed remains the same,
   You are past love, praise, indifference, blame.

_December_ 1912.



THE WALK


      YOU did not walk with me
      Of late to the hill-top tree
         By the gated ways,
         As in earlier days;
         You were weak and lame,
         So you never came,
   And I went alone, and I did not mind,
   Not thinking of you as left behind.

      I walked up there to-day
      Just in the former way:
         Surveyed around
         The familiar ground
         By myself again:
         What difference, then?
   Only that underlying sense
   Of the look of a room on returning thence.



RAIN ON A GRAVE


   CLOUDS spout upon her
      Their waters amain
      In ruthless disdain,—
   Her who but lately
      Had shivered with pain
   As at touch of dishonour
   If there had lit on her
   So coldly, so straightly
      Such arrows of rain.

   She who to shelter
      Her delicate head
   Would quicken and quicken
      Each tentative tread
   If drops chanced to pelt her
      That summertime spills
      In dust-paven rills
   When thunder-clouds thicken
      And birds close their bills.

   Would that I lay there
      And she were housed here!
   Or better, together
   Were folded away there
   Exposed to one weather
   We both,—who would stray there
   When sunny the day there,
      Or evening was clear
      At the prime of the year.

   Soon will be growing
      Green blades from her mound,
   And daises be showing
      Like stars on the ground,
   Till she form part of them—
   Ay—the sweet heart of them,
   Loved beyond measure
   With a child’s pleasure
      All her life’s round.

_Jan._ 31, 1913.



“I FOUND HER OUT THERE”


   I FOUND her out there
   On a slope few see,
   That falls westwardly
   To the salt-edged air,
   Where the ocean breaks
   On the purple strand,
   And the hurricane shakes
   The solid land.

   I brought her here,
   And have laid her to rest
   In a noiseless nest
   No sea beats near.
   She will never be stirred
   In her loamy cell
   By the waves long heard
   And loved so well.

   So she does not sleep
   By those haunted heights
   The Atlantic smites
   And the blind gales sweep,
   Whence she often would gaze
   At Dundagel’s far head,
   While the dipping blaze
   Dyed her face fire-red;

   And would sigh at the tale
   Of sunk Lyonnesse,
   As a wind-tugged tress
   Flapped her cheek like a flail;
   Or listen at whiles
   With a thought-bound brow
   To the murmuring miles
   She is far from now.

   Yet her shade, maybe,
   Will creep underground
   Till it catch the sound
   Of that western sea
   As it swells and sobs
   Where she once domiciled,
   And joy in its throbs
   With the heart of a child.



WITHOUT CEREMONY


   IT was your way, my dear,
   To be gone without a word
   When callers, friends, or kin
   Had left, and I hastened in
   To rejoin you, as I inferred.

   And when you’d a mind to career
   Off anywhere—say to town—
   You were all on a sudden gone
   Before I had thought thereon,
   Or noticed your trunks were down.

   So, now that you disappear
   For ever in that swift style,
   Your meaning seems to me
   Just as it used to be:
   “Good-bye is not worth while!”



LAMENT


   HOW she would have loved
   A party to-day!—
   Bright-hatted and gloved,
   With table and tray
   And chairs on the lawn
   Her smiles would have shone
   With welcomings . . . But
   She is shut, she is shut
      From friendship’s spell
      In the jailing shell
      Of her tiny cell.

   Or she would have reigned
   At a dinner to-night
   With ardours unfeigned,
   And a generous delight;
   All in her abode
   She’d have freely bestowed
   On her guests . . . But alas,
   She is shut under grass
      Where no cups flow,
      Powerless to know
      That it might be so.

   And she would have sought
   With a child’s eager glance
   The shy snowdrops brought
   By the new year’s advance,
   And peered in the rime
   Of Candlemas-time
   For crocuses . . . chanced
   It that she were not tranced
      From sights she loved best;
      Wholly possessed
      By an infinite rest!

   And we are here staying
   Amid these stale things
   Who care not for gaying,
   And those junketings
   That used so to joy her,
   And never to cloy her
   As us they cloy! . . . But
   She is shut, she is shut
      From the cheer of them, dead
      To all done and said
      In a yew-arched bed.



THE HAUNTER


   HE does not think that I haunt here nightly:
      How shall I let him know
   That whither his fancy sets him wandering
      I, too, alertly go?—
   Hover and hover a few feet from him
      Just as I used to do,
   But cannot answer his words addressed me—
      Only listen thereto!

   When I could answer he did not say them:
      When I could let him know
   How I would like to join in his journeys
      Seldom he wished to go.
   Now that he goes and wants me with him
      More than he used to do,
   Never he sees my faithful phantom
      Though he speaks thereto.

   Yes, I accompany him to places
      Only dreamers know,
   Where the shy hares limp long paces,
      Where the night rooks go;
   Into old aisles where the past is all to him,
      Close as his shade can do,
   Always lacking the power to call to him,
      Near as I reach thereto!

   What a good haunter I am, O tell him,
      Quickly make him know
   If he but sigh since my loss befell him
      Straight to his side I go.
   Tell him a faithful one is doing
      All that love can do
   Still that his path may be worth pursuing,
      And to bring peace thereto.



THE VOICE


   WOMAN much missed, how you call to me, call to me,
   Saying that now you are not as you were
   When you had changed from the one who was all to me,
   But as at first, when our day was fair.

   Can it be you that I hear?  Let me view you, then,
   Standing as when I drew near to the town
   Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then,
   Even to the original air-blue gown!

   Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness
   Travelling across the wet mead to me here,
   You being ever consigned to existlessness,
   Heard no more again far or near?

      Thus I; faltering forward,
      Leaves around me falling,
   Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward
      And the woman calling.

_December_ 1912.



HIS VISITOR


   I COME across from Mellstock while the moon wastes weaker
   To behold where I lived with you for twenty years and more:
   I shall go in the gray, at the passing of the mail-train,
   And need no setting open of the long familiar door
      As before.

   The change I notice in my once own quarters!
   A brilliant budded border where the daisies used to be,
   The rooms new painted, and the pictures altered,
   And other cups and saucers, and no cozy nook for tea
      As with me.

   I discern the dim faces of the sleep-wrapt servants;
   They are not those who tended me through feeble hours and strong,
   But strangers quite, who never knew my rule here,
   Who never saw me painting, never heard my softling song
      Float along.

   So I don’t want to linger in this re-decked dwelling,
   I feel too uneasy at the contrasts I behold,
   And I make again for Mellstock to return here never,
   And rejoin the roomy silence, and the mute and manifold
      Souls of old.

1913.



A CIRCULAR


   AS “legal representative”
   I read a missive not my own,
   On new designs the senders give
      For clothes, in tints as shown.

   Here figure blouses, gowns for tea,
   And presentation-trains of state,
   Charming ball-dresses, millinery,
      Warranted up to date.

   And this gay-pictured, spring-time shout
   Of Fashion, hails what lady proud?
   Her who before last year was out
      Was costumed in a shroud.



A DREAM OR NO


   WHY go to Saint-Juliot?  What’s Juliot to me?
      I was but made fancy
      By some necromancy
   That much of my life claims the spot as its key.

   Yes.  I have had dreams of that place in the West,
      And a maiden abiding
      Thereat as in hiding;
   Fair-eyed and white-shouldered, broad-browed and brown-tressed.

   And of how, coastward bound on a night long ago,
      There lonely I found her,
      The sea-birds around her,
   And other than nigh things uncaring to know.

   So sweet her life there (in my thought has it seemed)
      That quickly she drew me
      To take her unto me,
   And lodge her long years with me.  Such have I dreamed.

   But nought of that maid from Saint-Juliot I see;
      Can she ever have been here,
      And shed her life’s sheen here,
   The woman I thought a long housemate with me?

   Does there even a place like Saint-Juliot exist?
      Or a Vallency Valley
      With stream and leafed alley,
   Or Beeny, or Bos with its flounce flinging mist?

_February_ 1913.



AFTER A JOURNEY


   HERETO I come to interview a ghost;
      Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?
   Up the cliff, down, till I’m lonely, lost,
      And the unseen waters’ ejaculations awe me.
   Where you will next be there’s no knowing,
      Facing round about me everywhere,
         With your nut-coloured hair,
   And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.

   Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;
      Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;
   What have you now found to say of our past—
      Viewed across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?
   Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
      Things were not lastly as firstly well
         With us twain, you tell?
   But all’s closed now, despite Time’s derision.

   I see what you are doing: you are leading me on
      To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,
   The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone
      At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,
   And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow
      That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,
         When you were all aglow,
   And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow!

   Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,
      The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily,
   Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me,
      For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily.
   Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours,
      The bringing me here; nay, bring me here again!
         I am just the same as when
   Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers.

PENTARGAN BAY.



A DEATH-DAY RECALLED


   BEENY did not quiver,
      Juliot grew not gray,
   Thin Valency’s river
      Held its wonted way.
   Bos seemed not to utter
      Dimmest note of dirge,
   Targan mouth a mutter
      To its creamy surge.

   Yet though these, unheeding,
      Listless, passed the hour
   Of her spirit’s speeding,
      She had, in her flower,
   Sought and loved the places—
      Much and often pined
   For their lonely faces
      When in towns confined.

   Why did not Valency
      In his purl deplore
   One whose haunts were whence he
      Drew his limpid store?
   Why did Bos not thunder,
      Targan apprehend
   Body and breath were sunder
      Of their former friend?



BEENY CLIFF
_March_ 1870—_March_ 1913


                                    I

   O THE opal and the sapphire of that wandering western sea,
   And the woman riding high above with bright hair flapping free—
   The woman whom I loved so, and who loyally loved me.

                                    II

   The pale mews plained below us, and the waves seemed far away
   In a nether sky, engrossed in saying their ceaseless babbling say,
   As we laughed light-heartedly aloft on that clear-sunned March day.

                                   III

   A little cloud then cloaked us, and there flew an irised rain,
   And the Atlantic dyed its levels with a dull misfeatured stain,
   And then the sun burst out again, and purples prinked the main.

                                    IV

   —Still in all its chasmal beauty bulks old Beeny to the sky,
   And shall she and I not go there once again now March is nigh,
   And the sweet things said in that March say anew there by and by?

                                    V

   What if still in chasmal beauty looms that wild weird western shore,
   The woman now is—elsewhere—whom the ambling pony bore,
   And nor knows nor cares for Beeny, and will see it nevermore.



AT CASTLE BOTEREL


   As I drive to the junction of lane and highway,
      And the drizzle bedrenches the waggonette,
   I look behind at the fading byway,
      And see on its slope, now glistening wet,
         Distinctly yet

   Myself and a girlish form benighted
      In dry March weather.  We climb the road
   Beside a chaise.  We had just alighted
      To ease the sturdy pony’s load
         When he sighed and slowed.

   What we did as we climbed, and what we talked of
      Matters not much, nor to what it led,—
   Something that life will not be balked of
      Without rude reason till hope is dead,
         And feeling fled.

   It filled but a minute.  But was there ever
      A time of such quality, since or before,
   In that hill’s story?  To one mind never,
      Though it has been climbed, foot-swift, foot-sore,
      By thousands more.

   Primaeval rocks form the road’s steep border,
      And much have they faced there, first and last,
   Of the transitory in Earth’s long order;
      But what they record in colour and cast
         Is—that we two passed.

   And to me, though Time’s unflinching rigour,
      In mindless rote, has ruled from sight
   The substance now, one phantom figure
      Remains on the slope, as when that night
         Saw us alight.

   I look and see it there, shrinking, shrinking,
      I look back at it amid the rain
   For the very last time; for my sand is sinking,
      And I shall traverse old love’s domain
         Never again.

_March_ 1913.



PLACES


   NOBODY says: Ah, that is the place
   Where chanced, in the hollow of years ago,
   What none of the Three Towns cared to know—
   The birth of a little girl of grace—
   The sweetest the house saw, first or last;
      Yet it was so
      On that day long past.

   Nobody thinks: There, there she lay
   In a room by the Hoe, like the bud of a flower,
   And listened, just after the bedtime hour,
   To the stammering chimes that used to play
   The quaint Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth tune
      In Saint Andrew’s tower
      Night, morn, and noon.

   Nobody calls to mind that here
   Upon Boterel Hill, where the carters skid,
   With cheeks whose airy flush outbid
   Fresh fruit in bloom, and free of fear,
   She cantered down, as if she must fall
      (Though she never did),
      To the charm of all.

   Nay: one there is to whom these things,
   That nobody else’s mind calls back,
   Have a savour that scenes in being lack,
   And a presence more than the actual brings;
   To whom to-day is beneaped and stale,
      And its urgent clack
      But a vapid tale.

PLYMOUTH, _March_ 1913.



THE PHANTOM HORSEWOMAN


                                    I

   QUEER are the ways of a man I know:
      He comes and stands
      In a careworn craze,
      And looks at the sands
      And the seaward haze,
      With moveless hands
      And face and gaze,
      Then turns to go . . .
   And what does he see when he gazes so?

                                    II

   They say he sees as an instant thing
      More clear than to-day,
      A sweet soft scene
      That once was in play
      By that briny green;
      Yes, notes alway
      Warm, real, and keen,
      What his back years bring—
   A phantom of his own figuring.

                                   III

   Of this vision of his they might say more:
      Not only there
      Does he see this sight,
      But everywhere
      In his brain—day, night,
      As if on the air
      It were drawn rose bright—
      Yea, far from that shore
   Does he carry this vision of heretofore:

                                    IV

   A ghost-girl-rider.  And though, toil-tried,
      He withers daily,
      Time touches her not,
      But she still rides gaily
      In his rapt thought
      On that shagged and shaly
      Atlantic spot,
      And as when first eyed
   Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.




MISCELLANEOUS PIECES


THE WISTFUL LADY


   “LOVE, while you were away there came to me—
      From whence I cannot tell—
   A plaintive lady pale and passionless,
   Who bent her eyes upon me critically,
   And weighed me with a wearing wistfulness,
      As if she knew me well.”

   “I saw no lady of that wistful sort
      As I came riding home.
   Perhaps she was some dame the Fates constrain
   By memories sadder than she can support,
   Or by unhappy vacancy of brain,
      To leave her roof and roam?”

   “Ah, but she knew me.  And before this time
      I have seen her, lending ear
   To my light outdoor words, and pondering each,
   Her frail white finger swayed in pantomime,
   As if she fain would close with me in speech,
      And yet would not come near.

   “And once I saw her beckoning with her hand
      As I came into sight
   At an upper window.  And I at last went out;
   But when I reached where she had seemed to stand,
   And wandered up and down and searched about,
      I found she had vanished quite.”

   Then thought I how my dead Love used to say,
      With a small smile, when she
   Was waning wan, that she would hover round
   And show herself after her passing day
   To any newer Love I might have found,
      But show her not to me.



THE WOMAN IN THE RYE


   “WHY do you stand in the dripping rye,
   Cold-lipped, unconscious, wet to the knee,
   When there are firesides near?” said I.
   “I told him I wished him dead,” said she.

   “Yea, cried it in my haste to one
   Whom I had loved, whom I well loved still;
   And die he did.  And I hate the sun,
   And stand here lonely, aching, chill;

   “Stand waiting, waiting under skies
   That blow reproach, the while I see
   The rooks sheer off to where he lies
   Wrapt in a peace withheld from me.”



THE CHEVAL-GLASS


   WHY do you harbour that great cheval-glass
      Filling up your narrow room?
      You never preen or plume,
   Or look in a week at your full-length figure—
      Picture of bachelor gloom!

   “Well, when I dwelt in ancient England,
      Renting the valley farm,
      Thoughtless of all heart-harm,
   I used to gaze at the parson’s daughter,
      A creature of nameless charm.

   “Thither there came a lover and won her,
      Carried her off from my view.
      O it was then I knew
   Misery of a cast undreamt of—
      More than, indeed, my due!

   “Then far rumours of her ill-usage
      Came, like a chilling breath
      When a man languisheth;
   Followed by news that her mind lost balance,
      And, in a space, of her death.

   “Soon sank her father; and next was the auction—
      Everything to be sold:
      Mid things new and old
   Stood this glass in her former chamber,
      Long in her use, I was told.

   “Well, I awaited the sale and bought it . . .
      There by my bed it stands,
      And as the dawn expands
   Often I see her pale-faced form there
      Brushing her hair’s bright bands.

   “There, too, at pallid midnight moments
      Quick she will come to my call,
      Smile from the frame withal
   Ponderingly, as she used to regard me
      Passing her father’s wall.

   “So that it was for its revelations
      I brought it oversea,
      And drag it about with me . . .
   Anon I shall break it and bury its fragments
      Where my grave is to be.”



THE RE-ENACTMENT


      BETWEEN the folding sea-downs,
         In the gloom
      Of a wailful wintry nightfall,
         When the boom
   Of the ocean, like a hammering in a hollow tomb,

      Throbbed up the copse-clothed valley
         From the shore
      To the chamber where I darkled,
         Sunk and sore
   With gray ponderings why my Loved one had not come before

      To salute me in the dwelling
         That of late
      I had hired to waste a while in—
         Vague of date,
   Quaint, and remote—wherein I now expectant sate;

      On the solitude, unsignalled,
         Broke a man
      Who, in air as if at home there,
         Seemed to scan
   Every fire-flecked nook of the apartment span by span.

      A stranger’s and no lover’s
         Eyes were these,
      Eyes of a man who measures
         What he sees
   But vaguely, as if wrapt in filmy phantasies.

      Yea, his bearing was so absent
         As he stood,
      It bespoke a chord so plaintive
         In his mood,
   That soon I judged he would not wrong my quietude.

      “Ah—the supper is just ready,”
         Then he said,
      “And the years’-long binned Madeira
         Flashes red!”
   (There was no wine, no food, no supper-table spread.)

      “You will forgive my coming,
         Lady fair?
      I see you as at that time
         Rising there,
   The self-same curious querying in your eyes and air.

      “Yet no.  How so?  You wear not
         The same gown,
      Your locks show woful difference,
         Are not brown:
   What, is it not as when I hither came from town?

      “And the place . . . But you seem other—
         Can it be?
      What’s this that Time is doing
         Unto me?
   _You_ dwell here, unknown woman? . . . Whereabouts, then, is she?

      “And the house—things are much shifted.—
         Put them where
      They stood on this night’s fellow;
         Shift her chair:
   Here was the couch: and the piano should be there.”

      I indulged him, verily nerve-strained
         Being alone,
      And I moved the things as bidden,
         One by one,
   And feigned to push the old piano where he had shown.

      “Aha—now I can see her!
         Stand aside:
      Don’t thrust her from the table
         Where, meek-eyed,
   She makes attempt with matron-manners to preside.

      “She serves me: now she rises,
         Goes to play . . .
      But you obstruct her, fill her
         With dismay,
   And embarrassed, scared, she vanishes away!”

      And, as ’twere useless longer
         To persist,
      He sighed, and sought the entry
         Ere I wist,
   And retreated, disappearing soundless in the mist.

      That here some mighty passion
         Once had burned,
      Which still the walls enghosted,
         I discerned,
   And that by its strong spell mine might be overturned.

      I sat depressed; till, later,
         My Love came;
      But something in the chamber
         Dimmed our flame,—
   An emanation, making our due words fall tame,

      As if the intenser drama
         Shown me there
      Of what the walls had witnessed
         Filled the air,
   And left no room for later passion anywhere.

      So came it that our fervours
         Did quite fail
      Of future consummation—
         Being made quail
   By the weird witchery of the parlour’s hidden tale,

      Which I, as years passed, faintly
         Learnt to trace,—
      One of sad love, born full-winged
         In that place
   Where the predestined sorrowers first stood face to face.

      And as that month of winter
         Circles round,
      And the evening of the date-day
         Grows embrowned,
   I am conscious of those presences, and sit spellbound.

      There, often—lone, forsaken—
         Queries breed
      Within me; whether a phantom
         Had my heed
   On that strange night, or was it some wrecked heart indeed?



HER SECRET


   THAT love’s dull smart distressed my heart
      He shrewdly learnt to see,
   But that I was in love with a dead man
      Never suspected he.

   He searched for the trace of a pictured face,
      He watched each missive come,
   And a note that seemed like a love-line
      Made him look frozen and glum.

   He dogged my feet to the city street,
      He followed me to the sea,
   But not to the neighbouring churchyard
      Did he dream of following me.



“SHE CHARGED ME”


   SHE charged me with having said this and that
   To another woman long years before,
   In the very parlour where we sat,—

   Sat on a night when the endless pour
   Of rain on the roof and the road below
   Bent the spring of the spirit more and more . . .

   —So charged she me; and the Cupid’s bow
   Of her mouth was hard, and her eyes, and her face,
   And her white forefinger lifted slow.

   Had she done it gently, or shown a trace
   That not too curiously would she view
   A folly passed ere her reign had place,

   A kiss might have ended it.  But I knew
   From the fall of each word, and the pause between,
   That the curtain would drop upon us two
   Ere long, in our play of slave and queen.



THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE


   HE paused on the sill of a door ajar
   That screened a lively liquor-bar,
   For the name had reached him through the door
   Of her he had married the week before.

   “We called her the Hack of the Parade;
   But she was discreet in the games she played;
   If slightly worn, she’s pretty yet,
   And gossips, after all, forget.

   “And he knows nothing of her past;
   I am glad the girl’s in luck at last;
   Such ones, though stale to native eyes,
   Newcomers snatch at as a prize.”

   “Yes, being a stranger he sees her blent
   Of all that’s fresh and innocent,
   Nor dreams how many a love-campaign
   She had enjoyed before his reign!”

   That night there was the splash of a fall
   Over the slimy harbour-wall:
   They searched, and at the deepest place
   Found him with crabs upon his face.



A CONVERSATION AT DAWN


   HE lay awake, with a harassed air,
   And she, in her cloud of loose lank hair,
      Seemed trouble-tried
   As the dawn drew in on their faces there.

   The chamber looked far over the sea
   From a white hotel on a white-stoned quay,
      And stepping a stride
   He parted the window-drapery.

   Above the level horizon spread
   The sunrise, firing them foot to head
      From its smouldering lair,
   And painting their pillows with dyes of red.

   “What strange disquiets have stirred you, dear,
   This dragging night, with starts in fear
      Of me, as it were,
   Or of something evil hovering near?”

   “My husband, can I have fear of you?
   What should one fear from a man whom few,
      Or none, had matched
   In that late long spell of delays undue!”

   He watched her eyes in the heaving sun:
   “Then what has kept, O reticent one,
      Those lids unlatched—
   Anything promised I’ve not yet done?”

   “O it’s not a broken promise of yours
   (For what quite lightly your lip assures
      The due time brings)
   That has troubled my sleep, and no waking cures!” . . .

   “I have shaped my will; ’tis at hand,” said he;
   “I subscribe it to-day, that no risk there be
      In the hap of things
   Of my leaving you menaced by poverty.”

   “That a boon provision I’m safe to get,
   Signed, sealed by my lord as it were a debt,
      I cannot doubt,
   Or ever this peering sun be set.”

   “But you flung my arms away from your side,
   And faced the wall.  No month-old bride
      Ere the tour be out
   In an air so loth can be justified?

   “Ah—had you a male friend once loved well,
   Upon whose suit disaster fell
      And frustrance swift?
   Honest you are, and may care to tell.”

   She lay impassive, and nothing broke
   The stillness other than, stroke by stroke,
      The lazy lift
   Of the tide below them; till she spoke:

   “I once had a friend—a Love, if you will—
   Whose wife forsook him, and sank until
      She was made a thrall
   In a prison-cell for a deed of ill . . .

   “He remained alone; and we met—to love,
   But barring legitimate joy thereof
      Stood a doorless wall,
   Though we prized each other all else above.

   “And this was why, though I’d touched my prime,
   I put off suitors from time to time—
      Yourself with the rest—
   Till friends, who approved you, called it crime,

   “And when misgivings weighed on me
   In my lover’s absence, hurriedly,
      And much distrest,
   I took you . . . Ah, that such could be! . . .

   “Now, saw you when crossing from yonder shore
   At yesternoon, that the packet bore
      On a white-wreathed bier
   A coffined body towards the fore?

   “Well, while you stood at the other end,
   The loungers talked, and I could but lend
      A listening ear,
   For they named the dead.  ’Twas the wife of my friend.

   “He was there, but did not note me, veiled,
   Yet I saw that a joy, as of one unjailed,
      Now shone in his gaze;
   He knew not his hope of me just had failed!

   “They had brought her home: she was born in this isle;
   And he will return to his domicile,
      And pass his days
   Alone, and not as he dreamt erstwhile!”

   “—So you’ve lost a sprucer spouse than I!”
   She held her peace, as if fain deny
      She would indeed
   For his pleasure’s sake, but could lip no lie.

   “One far less formal and plain and slow!”
   She let the laconic assertion go
      As if of need
   She held the conviction that it was so.

   “Regard me as his he always should,
   He had said, and wed me he vowed he would
      In his prime or sere
   Most verily do, if ever he could.

   “And this fulfilment is now his aim,
   For a letter, addressed in my maiden name,
      Has dogged me here,
   Reminding me faithfully of his claim.

   “And it started a hope like a lightning-streak
   That I might go to him—say for a week—
      And afford you right
   To put me away, and your vows unspeak.

   “To be sure you have said, as of dim intent,
   That marriage is a plain event
      Of black and white,
   Without any ghost of sentiment,

   “And my heart has quailed.—But deny it true
   That you will never this lock undo!
      No God intends
   To thwart the yearning He’s father to!”

   The husband hemmed, then blandly bowed
   In the light of the angry morning cloud.
      “So my idyll ends,
   And a drama opens!” he mused aloud;

   And his features froze.  “You may take it as true
   That I will never this lock undo
      For so depraved
   A passion as that which kindles you.”

   Said she: “I am sorry you see it so;
   I had hoped you might have let me go,
      And thus been saved
   The pain of learning there’s more to know.”

   “More?  What may that be?  Gad, I think
   You have told me enough to make me blink!
      Yet if more remain
   Then own it to me.  I will not shrink!”

   “Well, it is this.  As we could not see
   That a legal marriage could ever be,
      To end our pain
   We united ourselves informally;

   “And vowed at a chancel-altar nigh,
   With book and ring, a lifelong tie;
      A contract vain
   To the world, but real to Him on High.”

   “And you became as his wife?”—“I did.”—
   He stood as stiff as a caryatid,
      And said, “Indeed! . . .
   No matter.  You’re mine, whatever you ye hid!”

   “But is it right!  When I only gave
   My hand to you in a sweat to save,
      Through desperate need
   (As I thought), my fame, for I was not brave!”

   “To save your fame?  Your meaning is dim,
   For nobody knew of your altar-whim?”
      “I mean—I feared
   There might be fruit of my tie with him;

   “And to cloak it by marriage I’m not the first,
   Though, maybe, morally most accurst
      Through your unpeered
   And strict uprightness.  That’s the worst!

   “While yesterday his worn contours
   Convinced me that love like his endures,
      And that my troth-plight
   Had been his, in fact, and not truly yours.”

   “So, my lady, you raise the veil by degrees . . .
   I own this last is enough to freeze
      The warmest wight!
   Now hear the other side, if you please:

   “I did say once, though without intent,
   That marriage is a plain event
      Of black and white,
   Whatever may be its sentiment.

   “I’ll act accordingly, none the less
   That you soiled the contract in time of stress,
      Thereto induced
   By the feared results of your wantonness.

   “But the thing is over, and no one knows,
   And it’s nought to the future what you disclose.
      That you’ll be loosed
   For such an episode, don’t suppose!

   “No: I’ll not free you.  And if it appear
   There was too good ground for your first fear
      From your amorous tricks,
   I’ll father the child.  Yes, by God, my dear.

   “Even should you fly to his arms, I’ll damn
   Opinion, and fetch you; treat as sham
      Your mutinous kicks,
   And whip you home.  That’s the sort I am!”

   She whitened. “Enough . . . Since you disapprove
   I’ll yield in silence, and never move
      Till my last pulse ticks
   A footstep from the domestic groove.”

   “Then swear it,” he said, “and your king uncrown.”
   He drew her forth in her long white gown,
      And she knelt and swore.
   “Good.  Now you may go and again lie down

   “Since you’ve played these pranks and given no sign,
   You shall crave this man of yours; pine and pine
      With sighings sore,
   ’Till I’ve starved your love for him; nailed you mine.

   “I’m a practical man, and want no tears;
   You’ve made a fool of me, it appears;
      That you don’t again
   Is a lesson I’ll teach you in future years.”

   She answered not, but lay listlessly
   With her dark dry eyes on the coppery sea,
      That now and then
   Flung its lazy flounce at the neighbouring quay.

A KING’S SOLILOQUY
ON THE NIGHT OF HIS FUNERAL


   FROM the slow march and muffled drum
      And crowds distrest,
   And book and bell, at length I have come
      To my full rest.

   A ten years’ rule beneath the sun
      Is wound up here,
   And what I have done, what left undone,
      Figures out clear.

   Yet in the estimate of such
      It grieves me more
   That I by some was loved so much
      Than that I bore,

   From others, judgment of that hue
      Which over-hope
   Breeds from a theoretic view
      Of regal scope.

   For kingly opportunities
      Right many have sighed;
   How best to bear its devilries
      Those learn who have tried!

   I have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet,
      Lived the life out
   From the first greeting glad drum-beat
      To the last shout.

   What pleasure earth affords to kings
      I have enjoyed
   Through its long vivid pulse-stirrings
      Even till it cloyed.

   What days of drudgery, nights of stress
      Can cark a throne,
   Even one maintained in peacefulness,
      I too have known.

   And so, I think, could I step back
      To life again,
   I should prefer the average track
      Of average men,

   Since, as with them, what kingship would
      It cannot do,
   Nor to first thoughts however good
      Hold itself true.

   Something binds hard the royal hand,
      As all that be,
   And it is That has shaped, has planned
      My acts and me.

_May_ 1910.



THE CORONATION


   AT Westminster, hid from the light of day,
   Many who once had shone as monarchs lay.

   Edward the Pious, and two Edwards more,
   The second Richard, Henrys three or four;

   That is to say, those who were called the Third,
   Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth (the much self-widowered),

   And James the Scot, and near him Charles the Second,
   And, too, the second George could there be reckoned.

   Of women, Mary and Queen Elizabeth,
   And Anne, all silent in a musing death;

   And William’s Mary, and Mary, Queen of Scots,
   And consort-queens whose names oblivion blots;

   And several more whose chronicle one sees
   Adorning ancient royal pedigrees.

   —Now, as they drowsed on, freed from Life’s old thrall,
   And heedless, save of things exceptional,

   Said one: “What means this throbbing thudding sound
   That reaches to us here from overground;

   “A sound of chisels, augers, planes, and saws,
   Infringing all ecclesiastic laws?

   “And these tons-weight of timber on us pressed,
   Unfelt here since we entered into rest?

   “Surely, at least to us, being corpses royal,
   A meet repose is owing by the loyal?”

   “—Perhaps a scaffold!” Mary Stuart sighed,
   “If such still be.  It was that way I died.”

   “—Ods!  Far more like,” said he the many-wived,
   “That for a wedding ’tis this work’s contrived.

   “Ha-ha!  I never would bow down to Rimmon,
   But I had a rare time with those six women!”

   “Not all at once?” gasped he who loved confession.
   “Nay, nay!” said Hal.  “That would have been transgression.”

   “—They build a catafalque here, black and tall,
   Perhaps,” mused Richard, “for some funeral?”

   And Anne chimed in: “Ah, yes: it maybe so!”
   “Nay!” squeaked Eliza.  “Little you seem to know—

   “Clearly ’tis for some crowning here in state,
   As they crowned us at our long bygone date;

   “Though we’d no such a power of carpentry,
   But let the ancient architecture be;

   “If I were up there where the parsons sit,
   In one of my gold robes, I’d see to it!”

   “But you are not,” Charles chuckled.  “You are here,
   And never will know the sun again, my dear!”

   “Yea,” whispered those whom no one had addressed;
   “With slow, sad march, amid a folk distressed,
   We were brought here, to take our dusty rest.

   “And here, alas, in darkness laid below,
   We’ll wait and listen, and endure the show . . .
   Clamour dogs kingship; afterwards not so!”

1911.



AQUAE SULIS


   THE chimes called midnight, just at interlune,
   And the daytime talk of the Roman investigations
   Was checked by silence, save for the husky tune
   The bubbling waters played near the excavations.

   And a warm air came up from underground,
   And a flutter, as of a filmy shape unsepulchred,
   That collected itself, and waited, and looked around:
   Nothing was seen, but utterances could be heard:

   Those of the goddess whose shrine was beneath the pile
   Of the God with the baldachined altar overhead:
   “And what did you get by raising this nave and aisle
   Close on the site of the temple I tenanted?

   “The notes of your organ have thrilled down out of view
   To the earth-clogged wrecks of my edifice many a year,
   Though stately and shining once—ay, long ere you
   Had set up crucifix and candle here.

   “Your priests have trampled the dust of mine without rueing,
   Despising the joys of man whom I so much loved,
   Though my springs boil on by your Gothic arcades and pewing,
   And sculptures crude . . . Would Jove they could be removed!”

   “—Repress, O lady proud, your traditional ires;
   You know not by what a frail thread we equally hang;
   It is said we are images both—twitched by people’s desires;
   And that I, like you, fail as a song men yesterday sang!”

                                * * * * *

   And the olden dark hid the cavities late laid bare,
   And all was suspended and soundless as before,
   Except for a gossamery noise fading off in the air,
   And the boiling voice of the waters’ medicinal pour.

BATH.



SEVENTY-FOUR AND TWENTY


   HERE goes a man of seventy-four,
   Who sees not what life means for him,
   And here another in years a score
   Who reads its very figure and trim.

   The one who shall walk to-day with me
   Is not the youth who gazes far,
   But the breezy wight who cannot see
   What Earth’s ingrained conditions are.



THE ELOPEMENT


   “A WOMAN never agreed to it!” said my knowing friend to me.
   “That one thing she’d refuse to do for Solomon’s mines in fee:
   No woman ever will make herself look older than she is.”
   I did not answer; but I thought, “you err there, ancient Quiz.”

   It took a rare one, true, to do it; for she was surely rare—
   As rare a soul at that sweet time of her life as she was fair.
   And urging motives, too, were strong, for ours was a passionate case,
   Yea, passionate enough to lead to freaking with that young face.

   I have told no one about it, should perhaps make few believe,
   But I think it over now that life looms dull and years bereave,
   How blank we stood at our bright wits’ end, two frail barks in
   distress,
   How self-regard in her was slain by her large tenderness.

   I said: “The only chance for us in a crisis of this kind
   Is going it thorough!”—“Yes,” she calmly breathed.  “Well, I don’t
   mind.”
   And we blanched her dark locks ruthlessly: set wrinkles on her brow;
   Ay—she was a right rare woman then, whatever she may be now.

   That night we heard a coach drive up, and questions asked below.
   “A gent with an elderly wife, sir,” was returned from the bureau.
   And the wheels went rattling on, and free at last from public ken
   We washed all off in her chamber and restored her youth again.

   How many years ago it was!  Some fifty can it be
   Since that adventure held us, and she played old wife to me?
   But in time convention won her, as it wins all women at last,
   And now she is rich and respectable, and time has buried the past.



“I ROSE UP AS MY CUSTOM IS”


   I ROSE up as my custom is
      On the eve of All-Souls’ day,
   And left my grave for an hour or so
   To call on those I used to know
      Before I passed away.

   I visited my former Love
      As she lay by her husband’s side;
   I asked her if life pleased her, now
   She was rid of a poet wrung in brow,
      And crazed with the ills he eyed;

   Who used to drag her here and there
      Wherever his fancies led,
   And point out pale phantasmal things,
   And talk of vain vague purposings
      That she discredited.

   She was quite civil, and replied,
      “Old comrade, is that you?
   Well, on the whole, I like my life.—
   I know I swore I’d be no wife,
      But what was I to do?

   “You see, of all men for my sex
      A poet is the worst;
   Women are practical, and they
   Crave the wherewith to pay their way,
      And slake their social thirst.

   “You were a poet—quite the ideal
      That we all love awhile:
   But look at this man snoring here—
   He’s no romantic chanticleer,
      Yet keeps me in good style.

   “He makes no quest into my thoughts,
      But a poet wants to know
   What one has felt from earliest days,
   Why one thought not in other ways,
      And one’s Loves of long ago.”

   Her words benumbed my fond frail ghost;
      The nightmares neighed from their stalls
   The vampires screeched, the harpies flew,
   And under the dim dawn I withdrew
      To Death’s inviolate halls.



A WEEK


   ON Monday night I closed my door,
   And thought you were not as heretofore,
   And little cared if we met no more.

   I seemed on Tuesday night to trace
   Something beyond mere commonplace
   In your ideas, and heart, and face.

   On Wednesday I did not opine
   Your life would ever be one with mine,
   Though if it were we should well combine.

   On Thursday noon I liked you well,
   And fondly felt that we must dwell
   Not far apart, whatever befell.

   On Friday it was with a thrill
   In gazing towards your distant vill
   I owned you were my dear one still.

   I saw you wholly to my mind
   On Saturday—even one who shrined
   All that was best of womankind.

   As wing-clipt sea-gull for the sea
   On Sunday night I longed for thee,
   Without whom life were waste to me!



HAD YOU WEPT


   HAD you wept; had you but neared me with a frail uncertain ray,
   Dewy as the face of the dawn, in your large and luminous eye,
   Then would have come back all the joys the tidings had slain that day,
   And a new beginning, a fresh fair heaven, have smoothed the things
   awry.
   But you were less feebly human, and no passionate need for clinging
   Possessed your soul to overthrow reserve when I came near;
   Ay, though you suffer as much as I from storms the hours are bringing
   Upon your heart and mine, I never see you shed a tear.

   The deep strong woman is weakest, the weak one is the strong;
   The weapon of all weapons best for winning, you have not used;
   Have you never been able, or would you not, through the evil times and
   long?
   Has not the gift been given you, or such gift have you refused?
   When I bade me not absolve you on that evening or the morrow,
   Why did you not make war on me with those who weep like rain?
   You felt too much, so gained no balm for all your torrid sorrow,
   And hence our deep division, and our dark undying pain.



BEREFT, SHE THINKS SHE DREAMS


   I DREAM that the dearest I ever knew
      Has died and been entombed.
   I am sure it’s a dream that cannot be true,
      But I am so overgloomed
   By its persistence, that I would gladly
      Have quick death take me,
   Rather than longer think thus sadly;
      So wake me, wake me!

   It has lasted days, but minute and hour
      I expect to get aroused
   And find him as usual in the bower
      Where we so happily housed.
   Yet stays this nightmare too appalling,
      And like a web shakes me,
   And piteously I keep on calling,
      And no one wakes me!



IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM


   “WHAT do you see in that time-touched stone,
      When nothing is there
   But ashen blankness, although you give it
      A rigid stare?

   “You look not quite as if you saw,
      But as if you heard,
   Parting your lips, and treading softly
      As mouse or bird.

   “It is only the base of a pillar, they’ll tell you,
      That came to us
   From a far old hill men used to name
      Areopagus.”

   —“I know no art, and I only view
      A stone from a wall,
   But I am thinking that stone has echoed
      The voice of Paul,

   “Paul as he stood and preached beside it
      Facing the crowd,
   A small gaunt figure with wasted features,
      Calling out loud

   “Words that in all their intimate accents
      Pattered upon
   That marble front, and were far reflected,
      And then were gone.

   “I’m a labouring man, and know but little,
      Or nothing at all;
   But I can’t help thinking that stone once echoed
      The voice of Paul.”



IN THE SERVANTS’ QUARTERS


   “MAN, you too, aren’t you, one of these rough followers of the
   criminal?
   All hanging hereabout to gather how he’s going to bear
   Examination in the hall.”  She flung disdainful glances on
   The shabby figure standing at the fire with others there,
      Who warmed them by its flare.

   “No indeed, my skipping maiden: I know nothing of the trial here,
   Or criminal, if so he be.—I chanced to come this way,
   And the fire shone out into the dawn, and morning airs are cold now;
   I, too, was drawn in part by charms I see before me play,
      That I see not every day.”

   “Ha, ha!” then laughed the constables who also stood to warm
   themselves,
   The while another maiden scrutinized his features hard,
   As the blaze threw into contrast every line and knot that wrinkled
   them,
   Exclaiming, “Why, last night when he was brought in by the guard,
      You were with him in the yard!”

   “Nay, nay, you teasing wench, I say!  You know you speak mistakenly.
   Cannot a tired pedestrian who has footed it afar
   Here on his way from northern parts, engrossed in humble marketings,
   Come in and rest awhile, although judicial doings are
      Afoot by morning star?”

   “O, come, come!” laughed the constables.  “Why, man, you speak the
   dialect
   He uses in his answers; you can hear him up the stairs.
   So own it.  We sha’n’t hurt ye.  There he’s speaking now!  His
   syllables
   Are those you sound yourself when you are talking unawares,
      As this pretty girl declares.”

   “And you shudder when his chain clinks!” she rejoined.  “O yes, I
   noticed it.
   And you winced, too, when those cuffs they gave him echoed to us here.
   They’ll soon be coming down, and you may then have to defend yourself
   Unless you hold your tongue, or go away and keep you clear
      When he’s led to judgment near!”

   “No!  I’ll be damned in hell if I know anything about the man!
   No single thing about him more than everybody knows!
   Must not I even warm my hands but I am charged with blasphemies?” . . .
   —His face convulses as the morning cock that moment crows,
      And he stops, and turns, and goes.



THE OBLITERATE TOMB


      “MORE than half my life long
   Did they weigh me falsely, to my bitter wrong,
   But they all have shrunk away into the silence
      Like a lost song.

      “And the day has dawned and come
   For forgiveness, when the past may hold it dumb
   On the once reverberate words of hatred uttered
      Half in delirium . . .

      “With folded lips and hands
   They lie and wait what next the Will commands,
   And doubtless think, if think they can: ‘Let discord
      Sink with Life’s sands!’

      “By these late years their names,
   Their virtues, their hereditary claims,
   May be as near defacement at their grave-place
      As are their fames.”

      —Such thoughts bechanced to seize
   A traveller’s mind—a man of memories—
   As he set foot within the western city
      Where had died these

      Who in their lifetime deemed
   Him their chief enemy—one whose brain had schemed
   To get their dingy greatness deeplier dingied
      And disesteemed.

      So, sojourning in their town,
   He mused on them and on their once renown,
   And said, “I’ll seek their resting-place to-morrow
      Ere I lie down,

      “And end, lest I forget,
   Those ires of many years that I regret,
   Renew their names, that men may see some liegeness
      Is left them yet.”

      Duly next day he went
   And sought the church he had known them to frequent,
   And wandered in the precincts, set on eyeing
      Where they lay pent,

      Till by remembrance led
   He stood at length beside their slighted bed,
   Above which, truly, scarce a line or letter
      Could now be read.

      “Thus years obliterate
   Their graven worth, their chronicle, their date!
   At once I’ll garnish and revive the record
      Of their past state,

      “That still the sage may say
   In pensive progress here where they decay,
   ‘This stone records a luminous line whose talents
      Told in their day.’”

      While speaking thus he turned,
   For a form shadowed where they lay inurned,
   And he beheld a stranger in foreign vesture,
      And tropic-burned.

      “Sir, I am right pleased to view
   That ancestors of mine should interest you,
   For I have come of purpose here to trace them . . .
      They are time-worn, true,

      “But that’s a fault, at most,
   Sculptors can cure.  On the Pacific coast
   I have vowed for long that relics of my forbears
      I’d trace ere lost,

      “And hitherward I come,
   Before this same old Time shall strike me numb,
   To carry it out.”—“Strange, this is!” said the other;
      “What mind shall plumb

      “Coincident design!
   Though these my father’s enemies were and mine,
   I nourished a like purpose—to restore them
      Each letter and line.”

      “Such magnanimity
   Is now not needed, sir; for you will see
   That since I am here, a thing like this is, plainly,
      Best done by me.”

      The other bowed, and left,
   Crestfallen in sentiment, as one bereft
   Of some fair object he had been moved to cherish,
      By hands more deft.

      And as he slept that night
   The phantoms of the ensepulchred stood up-right
   Before him, trembling that he had set him seeking
      Their charnel-site.

      And, as unknowing his ruth,
   Asked as with terrors founded not on truth
   Why he should want them.  “Ha,” they hollowly hackered,
      “You come, forsooth,

      “By stealth to obliterate
   Our graven worth, our chronicle, our date,
   That our descendant may not gild the record
      Of our past state,

      “And that no sage may say
   In pensive progress near where we decay:
   ‘This stone records a luminous line whose talents
      Told in their day.’”

      Upon the morrow he went
   And to that town and churchyard never bent
   His ageing footsteps till, some twelvemonths onward,
      An accident

      Once more detained him there;
   And, stirred by hauntings, he must needs repair
   To where the tomb was.  Lo, it stood still wasting
      In no man’s care.

      “The travelled man you met
   The last time,” said the sexton, “has not yet
   Appeared again, though wealth he had in plenty.
      —Can he forget?

      “The architect was hired
   And came here on smart summons as desired,
   But never the descendant came to tell him
      What he required.”

      And so the tomb remained
   Untouched, untended, crumbling, weather-stained,
   And though the one-time foe was fain to right it
      He still refrained.

      “I’ll set about it when
   I am sure he’ll come no more.  Best wait till then.”
   But so it was that never the stranger entered
      That city again.

      And the well-meaner died
   While waiting tremulously unsatisfied
   That no return of the family’s foreign scion
      Would still betide.

      And many years slid by,
   And active church-restorers cast their eye
   Upon the ancient garth and hoary building
      The tomb stood nigh.

      And when they had scraped each wall,
   Pulled out the stately pews, and smartened all,
   “It will be well,” declared the spruce church-warden,
      “To overhaul

      “And broaden this path where shown;
   Nothing prevents it but an old tombstone
   Pertaining to a family forgotten,
      Of deeds unknown.

      “Their names can scarce be read,
   Depend on’t, all who care for them are dead.”
   So went the tomb, whose shards were as path-paving
      Distributed.

      Over it and about
   Men’s footsteps beat, and wind and water-spout,
   Until the names, aforetime gnawed by weathers,
      Were quite worn out.

      So that no sage can say
   In pensive progress near where they decay,
   “This stone records a luminous line whose talents
      Told in their day.”



“REGRET NOT ME”


         REGRET not me;
      Beneath the sunny tree
   I lie uncaring, slumbering peacefully.

         Swift as the light
      I flew my faery flight;
   Ecstatically I moved, and feared no night.

         I did not know
      That heydays fade and go,
   But deemed that what was would be always so.

         I skipped at morn
      Between the yellowing corn,
   Thinking it good and glorious to be born.

         I ran at eves
      Among the piled-up sheaves,
   Dreaming, “I grieve not, therefore nothing grieves.”

         Now soon will come
      The apple, pear, and plum
   And hinds will sing, and autumn insects hum.

         Again you will fare
      To cider-makings rare,
   And junketings; but I shall not be there.

         Yet gaily sing
      Until the pewter ring
   Those songs we sang when we went gipsying.

         And lightly dance
      Some triple-timed romance
   In coupled figures, and forget mischance;

         And mourn not me
      Beneath the yellowing tree;
   For I shall mind not, slumbering peacefully.



THE RECALCITRANTS


   LET us off and search, and find a place
   Where yours and mine can be natural lives,
   Where no one comes who dissects and dives
   And proclaims that ours is a curious case,
   That its touch of romance can scarcely grace.

   You would think it strange at first, but then
   Everything has been strange in its time.
   When some one said on a day of the prime
   He would bow to no brazen god again
   He doubtless dazed the mass of men.

   None will recognize us as a pair whose claims
   To righteous judgment we care not making;
   Who have doubted if breath be worth the taking,
   And have no respect for the current fames
   Whence the savour has flown while abide the names.

   We have found us already shunned, disdained,
   And for re-acceptance have not once striven;
   Whatever offence our course has given
   The brunt thereof we have long sustained.
   Well, let us away, scorned unexplained.



STARLINGS ON THE ROOF


   “NO smoke spreads out of this chimney-pot,
   The people who lived here have left the spot,
   And others are coming who knew them not.

   “If you listen anon, with an ear intent,
   The voices, you’ll find, will be different
   From the well-known ones of those who went.”

   “Why did they go?  Their tones so bland
   Were quite familiar to our band;
   The comers we shall not understand.”

   “They look for a new life, rich and strange;
   They do not know that, let them range
   Wherever they may, they will get no change.

   “They will drag their house-gear ever so far
   In their search for a home no miseries mar;
   They will find that as they were they are,

   “That every hearth has a ghost, alack,
   And can be but the scene of a bivouac
   Till they move perforce—no time to pack!”



THE MOON LOOKS IN


                                    I

   I have risen again,
   And awhile survey
   By my chilly ray
   Through your window-pane
   Your upturned face,
   As you think, “Ah-she
   Now dreams of me
   In her distant place!”

                                    II

   I pierce her blind
   In her far-off home:
   She fixes a comb,
   And says in her mind,
   “I start in an hour;
   Whom shall I meet?
   Won’t the men be sweet,
   And the women sour!”



THE SWEET HUSSY


   IN his early days he was quite surprised
   When she told him she was compromised
   By meetings and lingerings at his whim,
   And thinking not of herself but him;
   While she lifted orbs aggrieved and round
   That scandal should so soon abound,
   (As she had raised them to nine or ten
   Of antecedent nice young men)
   And in remorse he thought with a sigh,
   How good she is, and how bad am I!—
   It was years before he understood
   That she was the wicked one—he the good.



THE TELEGRAM


   “O HE’S suffering—maybe dying—and I not there to aid,
   And smooth his bed and whisper to him!  Can I nohow go?
   Only the nurse’s brief twelve words thus hurriedly conveyed,
      As by stealth, to let me know.

   “He was the best and brightest!—candour shone upon his brow,
   And I shall never meet again a soldier such as he,
   And I loved him ere I knew it, and perhaps he’s sinking now,
      Far, far removed from me!”

   —The yachts ride mute at anchor and the fulling moon is fair,
   And the giddy folk are strutting up and down the smooth parade,
   And in her wild distraction she seems not to be aware
      That she lives no more a maid,

   But has vowed and wived herself to one who blessed the ground she trod
   To and from his scene of ministry, and thought her history known
   In its last particular to him—aye, almost as to God,
      And believed her quite his own.

   So great her absentmindedness she droops as in a swoon,
   And a movement of aversion mars her recent spousal grace,
   And in silence we two sit here in our waning honeymoon
      At this idle watering-place . . .

   What now I see before me is a long lane overhung
   With lovelessness, and stretching from the present to the grave.
   And I would I were away from this, with friends I knew when young,
      Ere a woman held me slave.



THE MOTH-SIGNAL
(_On Egdon Heath_)


   “WHAT are you still, still thinking,”
      He asked in vague surmise,
   “That stare at the wick unblinking
      With those great lost luminous eyes?”

   “O, I see a poor moth burning
      In the candle-flame,” said she,
   “Its wings and legs are turning
      To a cinder rapidly.”

   “Moths fly in from the heather,”
      He said, “now the days decline.”
   “I know,” said she.  “The weather,
      I hope, will at last be fine.

   “I think,” she added lightly,
      “I’ll look out at the door.
   The ring the moon wears nightly
      May be visible now no more.”

   She rose, and, little heeding,
      Her husband then went on
   With his attentive reading
      In the annals of ages gone.

   Outside the house a figure
      Came from the tumulus near,
   And speedily waxed bigger,
      And clasped and called her Dear.

   “I saw the pale-winged token
      You sent through the crack,” sighed she.
   “That moth is burnt and broken
      With which you lured out me.

   “And were I as the moth is
      It might be better far
   For one whose marriage troth is
      Shattered as potsherds are!”

   Then grinned the Ancient Briton
      From the tumulus treed with pine:
   “So, hearts are thwartly smitten
      In these days as in mine!”



SEEN BY THE WAITS


   THROUGH snowy woods and shady
      We went to play a tune
   To the lonely manor-lady
      By the light of the Christmas moon.

   We violed till, upward glancing
      To where a mirror leaned,
   We saw her airily dancing,
      Deeming her movements screened;

   Dancing alone in the room there,
      Thin-draped in her robe of night;
   Her postures, glassed in the gloom there,
      Were a strange phantasmal sight.

   She had learnt (we heard when homing)
      That her roving spouse was dead;
   Why she had danced in the gloaming
      We thought, but never said.



THE TWO SOLDIERS


   JUST at the corner of the wall
      We met—yes, he and I—
   Who had not faced in camp or hall
      Since we bade home good-bye,
   And what once happened came back—all—
      Out of those years gone by.

   And that strange woman whom we knew
      And loved—long dead and gone,
   Whose poor half-perished residue,
      Tombless and trod, lay yon!
   But at this moment to our view
      Rose like a phantom wan.

   And in his fixed face I could see,
      Lit by a lurid shine,
   The drama re-enact which she
      Had dyed incarnadine
   For us, and more.  And doubtless he
      Beheld it too in mine.

   A start, as at one slightly known,
      And with an indifferent air
   We passed, without a sign being shown
      That, as it real were,
   A memory-acted scene had thrown
      Its tragic shadow there.



THE DEATH OF REGRET


   I OPENED my shutter at sunrise,
      And looked at the hill hard by,
   And I heartily grieved for the comrade
      Who wandered up there to die.

   I let in the morn on the morrow,
      And failed not to think of him then,
   As he trod up that rise in the twilight,
      And never came down again.

   I undid the shutter a week thence,
      But not until after I’d turned
   Did I call back his last departure
      By the upland there discerned.

   Uncovering the casement long later,
      I bent to my toil till the gray,
   When I said to myself, “Ah—what ails me,
      To forget him all the day!”

   As daily I flung back the shutter
      In the same blank bald routine,
   He scarcely once rose to remembrance
      Through a month of my facing the scene.

   And ah, seldom now do I ponder
      At the window as heretofore
   On the long valued one who died yonder,
      And wastes by the sycamore.



IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE


   A PLAIN tilt-bonnet on her head
   She took the path across the leaze.
   —Her spouse the vicar, gardening, said,
   “Too dowdy that, for coquetries,
      So I can hoe at ease.”

   But when she had passed into the heath,
   And gained the wood beyond the flat,
   She raised her skirts, and from beneath
   Unpinned and drew as from a sheath
      An ostrich-feathered hat.

   And where the hat had hung she now
   Concealed and pinned the dowdy hood,
   And set the hat upon her brow,
   And thus emerging from the wood
      Tripped on in jaunty mood.

   The sun was low and crimson-faced
   As two came that way from the town,
   And plunged into the wood untraced . . .
   When separately therefrom they paced
      The sun had quite gone down.

   The hat and feather disappeared,
   The dowdy hood again was donned,
   And in the gloom the fair one neared
   Her home and husband dour, who conned
      Calmly his blue-eyed blonde.

   “To-day,” he said, “you have shown good sense,
   A dress so modest and so meek
   Should always deck your goings hence
   Alone.”  And as a recompense
      He kissed her on the cheek.



THE ROMAN GRAVEMOUNDS


   BY Rome’s dim relics there walks a man,
   Eyes bent; and he carries a basket and spade;
   I guess what impels him to scrape and scan;
   Yea, his dreams of that Empire long decayed.

   “Vast was Rome,” he must muse, “in the world’s regard,
   Vast it looms there still, vast it ever will be;”
   And he stoops as to dig and unmine some shard
   Left by those who are held in such memory.

   But no; in his basket, see, he has brought
   A little white furred thing, stiff of limb,
   Whose life never won from the world a thought;
   It is this, and not Rome, that is moving him.

   And to make it a grave he has come to the spot,
   And he delves in the ancient dead’s long home;
   Their fames, their achievements, the man knows not;
   The furred thing is all to him—nothing Rome!

   “Here say you that Cæsar’s warriors lie?—
   But my little white cat was my only friend!
   Could she but live, might the record die
   Of Cæsar, his legions, his aims, his end!”

   Well, Rome’s long rule here is oft and again
   A theme for the sages of history,
   And the small furred life was worth no one’s pen;
   Yet its mourner’s mood has a charm for me.

_November_ 1910.



THE WORKBOX


   “SEE, here’s the workbox, little wife,
      That I made of polished oak.”
   He was a joiner, of village life;
      She came of borough folk.

   He holds the present up to her
   As with a smile she nears
   And answers to the profferer,
   “’Twill last all my sewing years!”

   “I warrant it will.  And longer too.
   ’Tis a scantling that I got
   Off poor John Wayward’s coffin, who
   Died of they knew not what.

   “The shingled pattern that seems to cease
   Against your box’s rim
   Continues right on in the piece
   That’s underground with him.

   “And while I worked it made me think
   Of timber’s varied doom;
   One inch where people eat and drink,
   The next inch in a tomb.

   “But why do you look so white, my dear,
   And turn aside your face?
   You knew not that good lad, I fear,
   Though he came from your native place?”

   “How could I know that good young man,
   Though he came from my native town,
   When he must have left there earlier than
   I was a woman grown?”

   “Ah no.  I should have understood!
   It shocked you that I gave
   To you one end of a piece of wood
   Whose other is in a grave?”

   “Don’t, dear, despise my intellect,
   Mere accidental things
   Of that sort never have effect
   On my imaginings.”

   Yet still her lips were limp and wan,
   Her face still held aside,
   As if she had known not only John,
   But known of what he died.



THE SACRILEGE
A BALLAD-TRAGEDY
(_Circa_ 182-)


PART I


   “I HAVE a Love I love too well
   Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor;
   I have a Love I love too well,
      To whom, ere she was mine,
   ‘Such is my love for you,’ I said,
   ‘That you shall have to hood your head
   A silken kerchief crimson-red,
      Wove finest of the fine.’

   “And since this Love, for one mad moon,
   On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor,
   Since this my Love for one mad moon
      Did clasp me as her king,
   I snatched a silk-piece red and rare
   From off a stall at Priddy Fair,
   For handkerchief to hood her hair
      When we went gallanting.

   “Full soon the four weeks neared their end
   Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor;
   And when the four weeks neared their end,
      And their swift sweets outwore,
   I said, ‘What shall I do to own
   Those beauties bright as tulips blown,
   And keep you here with me alone
      As mine for evermore?’

   “And as she drowsed within my van
   On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor—
   And as she drowsed within my van,
      And dawning turned to day,
   She heavily raised her sloe-black eyes
   And murmured back in softest wise,
   ‘One more thing, and the charms you prize
      Are yours henceforth for aye.

   “‘And swear I will I’ll never go
   While Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor
   To meet the Cornish Wrestler Joe
      For dance and dallyings.
   If you’ll to yon cathedral shrine,
   And finger from the chest divine
   Treasure to buy me ear-drops fine,
      And richly jewelled rings.’

   “I said: ‘I am one who has gathered gear
   From Marlbury Downs to Dunkery Tor,
   Who has gathered gear for many a year
      From mansion, mart and fair;
   But at God’s house I’ve stayed my hand,
   Hearing within me some command—
   Curbed by a law not of the land
      From doing damage there.’

   “Whereat she pouts, this Love of mine,
   As Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor,
   And still she pouts, this Love of mine,
      So cityward I go.
   But ere I start to do the thing,
   And speed my soul’s imperilling
   For one who is my ravishing
      And all the joy I know,

   “I come to lay this charge on thee—
   On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor—
   I come to lay this charge on thee
      With solemn speech and sign:
   Should things go ill, and my life pay
   For botchery in this rash assay,
   You are to take hers likewise—yea,
      The month the law takes mine.

   “For should my rival, Wrestler Joe,
   Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor—
   My reckless rival, Wrestler Joe,
      My Love’s possessor be,
   My tortured spirit would not rest,
   But wander weary and distrest
   Throughout the world in wild protest:
      The thought nigh maddens me!”


PART II


   Thus did he speak—this brother of mine—
   On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor,
   Born at my birth of mother of mine,
      And forthwith went his way
   To dare the deed some coming night . . .
   I kept the watch with shaking sight,
   The moon at moments breaking bright,
      At others glooming gray.

   For three full days I heard no sound
   Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor,
   I heard no sound at all around
      Whether his fay prevailed,
   Or one malign the master were,
   Till some afoot did tidings bear
   How that, for all his practised care,
      He had been caught and jailed.

   They had heard a crash when twelve had chimed
   By Mendip east of Dunkery Tor,
   When twelve had chimed and moonlight climbed;
      They watched, and he was tracked
   By arch and aisle and saint and knight
   Of sculptured stonework sheeted white
   In the cathedral’s ghostly light,
      And captured in the act.

   Yes; for this Love he loved too well
   Where Dunkery sights the Severn shore,
   All for this Love he loved too well
      He burst the holy bars,
   Seized golden vessels from the chest
   To buy her ornaments of the best,
   At her ill-witchery’s request
      And lure of eyes like stars . . .

   When blustering March confused the sky
   In Toneborough Town by Exon Moor,
   When blustering March confused the sky
      They stretched him; and he died.
   Down in the crowd where I, to see
   The end of him, stood silently,
   With a set face he lipped to me—
      “Remember.”  “Ay!” I cried.

   By night and day I shadowed her
   From Toneborough Deane to Dunkery Tor,
   I shadowed her asleep, astir,
      And yet I could not bear—
   Till Wrestler Joe anon began
   To figure as her chosen man,
   And took her to his shining van—
      To doom a form so fair!

   He made it handsome for her sake—
   And Dunkery smiled to Exon Moor—
   He made it handsome for her sake,
      Painting it out and in;
   And on the door of apple-green
   A bright brass knocker soon was seen,
   And window-curtains white and clean
      For her to sit within.

   And all could see she clave to him
   As cleaves a cloud to Dunkery Tor,
   Yea, all could see she clave to him,
      And every day I said,
   “A pity it seems to part those two
   That hourly grow to love more true:
   Yet she’s the wanton woman who
      Sent one to swing till dead!”

   That blew to blazing all my hate,
   While Dunkery frowned on Exon Moor,
   And when the river swelled, her fate
      Came to her pitilessly . . .
   I dogged her, crying: “Across that plank
   They use as bridge to reach yon bank
   A coat and hat lie limp and dank;
      Your goodman’s, can they be?”

   She paled, and went, I close behind—
   And Exon frowned to Dunkery Tor,
   She went, and I came up behind
      And tipped the plank that bore
   Her, fleetly flitting across to eye
   What such might bode.  She slid awry;
   And from the current came a cry,
      A gurgle; and no more.

   How that befell no mortal knew
   From Marlbury Downs to Exon Moor;
   No mortal knew that deed undue
      But he who schemed the crime,
   Which night still covers . . . But in dream
   Those ropes of hair upon the stream
   He sees, and he will hear that scream
      Until his judgment-time.



THE ABBEY MASON
(_Inventor of the_ “_Perpendicular_” _Style of Gothic Architecture_)


   THE new-vamped Abbey shaped apace
   In the fourteenth century of grace;

   (The church which, at an after date,
   Acquired cathedral rank and state.)

   Panel and circumscribing wall
   Of latest feature, trim and tall,

   Rose roundabout the Norman core
   In prouder pose than theretofore,

   Encasing magically the old
   With parpend ashlars manifold.

   The trowels rang out, and tracery
   Appeared where blanks had used to be.

   Men toiled for pleasure more than pay,
   And all went smoothly day by day,

   Till, in due course, the transept part
   Engrossed the master-mason’s art.

   —Home-coming thence he tossed and turned
   Throughout the night till the new sun burned.

   “What fearful visions have inspired
   These gaingivings?” his wife inquired;

   “As if your tools were in your hand
   You have hammered, fitted, muttered, planned;

   “You have thumped as you were working hard:
   I might have found me bruised and scarred.

   “What then’s amiss.  What eating care
   Looms nigh, whereof I am unaware?”

   He answered not, but churchward went,
   Viewing his draughts with discontent;

   And fumbled there the livelong day
   Till, hollow-eyed, he came away.

   —’Twas said, “The master-mason’s ill!”
   And all the abbey works stood still.

   Quoth Abbot Wygmore: “Why, O why
   Distress yourself?  You’ll surely die!”

   The mason answered, trouble-torn,
   “This long-vogued style is quite outworn!

   “The upper archmould nohow serves
   To meet the lower tracery curves:

   “The ogees bend too far away
   To give the flexures interplay.

   “This it is causes my distress . . .
   So it will ever be unless

   “New forms be found to supersede
   The circle when occasions need.

   “To carry it out I have tried and toiled,
   And now perforce must own me foiled!

   “Jeerers will say: ‘Here was a man
   Who could not end what he began!’”

   —So passed that day, the next, the next;
   The abbot scanned the task, perplexed;

   The townsmen mustered all their wit
   To fathom how to compass it,

   But no raw artistries availed
   Where practice in the craft had failed . . .

   —One night he tossed, all open-eyed,
   And early left his helpmeet’s side.

   Scattering the rushes of the floor
   He wandered from the chamber door

   And sought the sizing pile, whereon
   Struck dimly a cadaverous dawn

   Through freezing rain, that drenched the board
   Of diagram-lines he last had scored—

   Chalked phantasies in vain begot
   To knife the architectural knot—

   In front of which he dully stood,
   Regarding them in hopeless mood.

   He closelier looked; then looked again:
   The chalk-scratched draught-board faced the rain,

   Whose icicled drops deformed the lines
   Innumerous of his lame designs,

   So that they streamed in small white threads
   From the upper segments to the heads

   Of arcs below, uniting them
   Each by a stalactitic stem.

   —At once, with eyes that struck out sparks,
   He adds accessory cusping-marks,

   Then laughs aloud.  The thing was done
   So long assayed from sun to sun . . .

   —Now in his joy he grew aware
   Of one behind him standing there,

   And, turning, saw the abbot, who
   The weather’s whim was watching too.

   Onward to Prime the abbot went,
   Tacit upon the incident.

   —Men now discerned as days revolved
   The ogive riddle had been solved;

   Templates were cut, fresh lines were chalked
   Where lines had been defaced and balked,

   And the work swelled and mounted higher,
   Achievement distancing desire;

   Here jambs with transoms fixed between,
   Where never the like before had been—

   There little mullions thinly sawn
   Where meeting circles once were drawn.

   “We knew,” men said, “the thing would go
   After his craft-wit got aglow,

   “And, once fulfilled what he has designed,
   We’ll honour him and his great mind!”

   When matters stood thus poised awhile,
   And all surroundings shed a smile,

   The master-mason on an eve
   Homed to his wife and seemed to grieve . . .

   —“The abbot spoke to me to-day:
   He hangs about the works alway.

   “He knows the source as well as I
   Of the new style men magnify.

   “He said: ‘You pride yourself too much
   On your creation.  Is it such?

   “‘Surely the hand of God it is
   That conjured so, and only His!—

   “‘Disclosing by the frost and rain
   Forms your invention chased in vain;

   “‘Hence the devices deemed so great
   You copied, and did not create.’

   “I feel the abbot’s words are just,
   And that all thanks renounce I must.

   “Can a man welcome praise and pelf
   For hatching art that hatched itself? . . .

   “So, I shall own the deft design
   Is Heaven’s outshaping, and not mine.”

   “What!” said she.  “Praise your works ensure
   To throw away, and quite obscure

   “Your beaming and beneficent star?
   Better you leave things as they are!

   “Why, think awhile.  Had not your zest
   In your loved craft curtailed your rest—

   “Had you not gone there ere the day
   The sun had melted all away!”

   —But, though his good wife argued so,
   The mason let the people know

   That not unaided sprang the thought
   Whereby the glorious fane was wrought,

   But that by frost when dawn was dim
   The method was disclosed to him.

   “Yet,” said the townspeople thereat,
   “’Tis your own doing, even with that!”

   But he—chafed, childlike, in extremes—
   The temperament of men of dreams—

   Aloofly scrupled to admit
   That he did aught but borrow it,

   And diffidently made request
   That with the abbot all should rest.

   —As none could doubt the abbot’s word,
   Or question what the church averred,

   The mason was at length believed
   Of no more count than he conceived,

   And soon began to lose the fame
   That late had gathered round his name . . .

   —Time passed, and like a living thing
   The pile went on embodying,

   And workmen died, and young ones grew,
   And the old mason sank from view

   And Abbots Wygmore and Staunton went
   And Horton sped the embellishment.

   But not till years had far progressed
   Chanced it that, one day, much impressed,

   Standing within the well-graced aisle,
   He asked who first conceived the style;

   And some decrepit sage detailed
   How, when invention nought availed,

   The cloud-cast waters in their whim
   Came down, and gave the hint to him

   Who struck each arc, and made each mould;
   And how the abbot would not hold

   As sole begetter him who applied
   Forms the Almighty sent as guide;

   And how the master lost renown,
   And wore in death no artist’s crown.

   —Then Horton, who in inner thought
   Had more perceptions than he taught,

   Replied: “Nay; art can but transmute;
   Invention is not absolute;

   “Things fail to spring from nought at call,
   And art-beginnings most of all.

   “He did but what all artists do,
   Wait upon Nature for his cue.”

   —“Had you been here to tell them so
   Lord Abbot, sixty years ago,

   “The mason, now long underground,
   Doubtless a different fate had found.

   “He passed into oblivion dim,
   And none knew what became of him!

   “His name?  ’Twas of some common kind
   And now has faded out of mind.”

   The Abbot: “It shall not be hid!
   I’ll trace it.” . . . But he never did.

   —When longer yet dank death had wormed
   The brain wherein the style had germed

   From Gloucester church it flew afar—
   The style called Perpendicular.—

   To Winton and to Westminster
   It ranged, and grew still beautifuller:

   From Solway Frith to Dover Strand
   Its fascinations starred the land,

   Not only on cathedral walls
   But upon courts and castle halls,

   Till every edifice in the isle
   Was patterned to no other style,

   And till, long having played its part,
   The curtain fell on Gothic art.

   —Well: when in Wessex on your rounds,
   Take a brief step beyond its bounds,

   And enter Gloucester: seek the quoin
   Where choir and transept interjoin,

   And, gazing at the forms there flung
   Against the sky by one unsung—

   The ogee arches transom-topped,
   The tracery-stalks by spandrels stopped,

   Petrified lacework—lightly lined
   On ancient massiveness behind—

   Muse that some minds so modest be
   As to renounce fame’s fairest fee,

   (Like him who crystallized on this spot
   His visionings, but lies forgot,

   And many a mediaeval one
   Whose symmetries salute the sun)

   While others boom a baseless claim,
   And upon nothing rear a name.



THE JUBILEE OF A MAGAZINE
(_To the Editor_)


   YES; your up-dated modern page—
   All flower-fresh, as it appears—
   Can claim a time-tried lineage,

   That reaches backward fifty years
   (Which, if but short for sleepy squires,
   Is much in magazines’ careers).

   —Here, on your cover, never tires
   The sower, reaper, thresher, while
   As through the seasons of our sires

   Each wills to work in ancient style
   With seedlip, sickle, share and flail,
   Though modes have since moved many a mile!

   The steel-roped plough now rips the vale,
   With cog and tooth the sheaves are won,
   Wired wheels drum out the wheat like hail;

   But if we ask, what has been done
   To unify the mortal lot
   Since your bright leaves first saw the sun,

   Beyond mechanic furtherance—what
   Advance can rightness, candour, claim?
   Truth bends abashed, and answers not.

   Despite your volumes’ gentle aim
   To straighten visions wry and wrong,
   Events jar onward much the same!

   —Had custom tended to prolong,
   As on your golden page engrained,
   Old processes of blade and prong,

   And best invention been retained
   For high crusades to lessen tears
   Throughout the race, the world had gained! . . .
   But too much, this, for fifty years.



THE SATIN SHOES


   “IF ever I walk to church to wed,
      As other maidens use,
   And face the gathered eyes,” she said,
      “I’ll go in satin shoes!”

   She was as fair as early day
      Shining on meads unmown,
   And her sweet syllables seemed to play
      Like flute-notes softly blown.

   The time arrived when it was meet
      That she should be a bride;
   The satin shoes were on her feet,
      Her father was at her side.

   They stood within the dairy door,
      And gazed across the green;
   The church loomed on the distant moor,
      But rain was thick between.

   “The grass-path hardly can be stepped,
      The lane is like a pool!”—
   Her dream is shown to be inept,
      Her wish they overrule.

   “To go forth shod in satin soft
      A coach would be required!”
   For thickest boots the shoes were doffed—
      Those shoes her soul desired . . .

   All day the bride, as overborne,
      Was seen to brood apart,
   And that the shoes had not been worn
      Sat heavy on her heart.

   From her wrecked dream, as months flew on,
      Her thought seemed not to range.
   “What ails the wife?” they said anon,
      “That she should be so strange?” . . .

   Ah—what coach comes with furtive glide—
      A coach of closed-up kind?
   It comes to fetch the last year’s bride,
      Who wanders in her mind.

   She strove with them, and fearfully ran
      Stairward with one low scream:
   “Nay—coax her,” said the madhouse man,
      “With some old household theme.”

   “If you will go, dear, you must fain
      Put on those shoes—the pair
   Meant for your marriage, which the rain
      Forbade you then to wear.”

   She clapped her hands, flushed joyous hues;
      “O yes—I’ll up and ride
   If I am to wear my satin shoes
      And be a proper bride!”

   Out then her little foot held she,
      As to depart with speed;
   The madhouse man smiled pleasantly
      To see the wile succeed.

   She turned to him when all was done,
      And gave him her thin hand,
   Exclaiming like an enraptured one,
      “This time it will be grand!”

   She mounted with a face elate,
      Shut was the carriage door;
   They drove her to the madhouse gate,
      And she was seen no more . . .

   Yet she was fair as early day
      Shining on meads unmown,
   And her sweet syllables seemed to play
      Like flute-notes softly blown.



EXEUNT OMNES


                                    I

      EVERYBODY else, then, going,
   And I still left where the fair was? . . .
   Much have I seen of neighbour loungers
      Making a lusty showing,
      Each now past all knowing.

                                    II

      There is an air of blankness
   In the street and the littered spaces;
   Thoroughfare, steeple, bridge and highway
      Wizen themselves to lankness;
      Kennels dribble dankness.

                                   III

      Folk all fade.  And whither,
   As I wait alone where the fair was?
   Into the clammy and numbing night-fog
      Whence they entered hither.
      Soon do I follow thither!

A POET


   ATTENTIVE eyes, fantastic heed,
   Assessing minds, he does not need,
   Nor urgent writs to sup or dine,
   Nor pledges in the roseate wine.

   For loud acclaim he does not care
   By the august or rich or fair,
   Nor for smart pilgrims from afar,
   Curious on where his hauntings are.

   But soon or later, when you hear
   That he has doffed this wrinkled gear,
   Some evening, at the first star-ray,
   Come to his graveside, pause and say:

   “Whatever the message his to tell,
   Two bright-souled women loved him well.”
   Stand and say that amid the dim:
   It will be praise enough for him.

POSTSCRIPT
“MEN WHO MARCH AWAY”
(SONG OF THE SOLDIERS)


   WHAT of the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away
      Ere the barn-cocks say
      Night is growing gray,
   To hazards whence no tears can win us;
   What of the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away?

   Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
      Friend with the musing eye,
      Who watch us stepping by
      With doubt and dolorous sigh?
   Can much pondering so hoodwink you!
   Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
      Friend with the musing eye?

   Nay.  We well see what we are doing,
      Though some may not see—
      Dalliers as they be—
      England’s need are we;
   Her distress would leave us rueing:
   Nay.  We well see what we are doing,
      Though some may not see!

   In our heart of hearts believing
      Victory crowns the just,
      And that braggarts must
      Surely bite the dust,
   Press we to the field ungrieving,
   In our heart of hearts believing
      Victory crowns the just.

   Hence the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away
      Ere the barn-cocks say
      Night is growing gray,
   To hazards whence no tears can win us:
   Hence the faith and fire within us
      Men who march away.

THE REVISITATION


      AS I lay awake at night-time
   In an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers,
   And recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and bright
   time
      Of my primal purple years,

      Much it haunted me that, nigh there,
   I had borne my bitterest loss—when One who went, came not again;
   In a joyless hour of discord, in a joyless-hued July there—
      A July just such as then.

      And as thus I brooded longer,
   With my faint eyes on the feeble square of wan-lit window frame,
   A quick conviction sprung within me, grew, and grew yet stronger,
      That the month-night was the same,

      Too, as that which saw her leave me
   On the rugged ridge of Waterstone, the peewits plaining round;
   And a lapsing twenty years had ruled that—as it were to grieve me—
      I should near the once-loved ground.

      Though but now a war-worn stranger
   Chance had quartered here, I rose up and descended to the yard.
   All was soundless, save the troopers’ horses tossing at the manger,
      And the sentry keeping guard.

      Through the gateway I betook me
   Down the High Street and beyond the lamps, across the battered bridge,
   Till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine forsook
   me,
      And I bore towards the Ridge,

      With a dim unowned emotion
   Saying softly: “Small my reason, now at midnight, to be here . . .
   Yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion
      May retrace a track so dear.”

      Thus I walked with thoughts half-uttered
   Up the lane I knew so well, the grey, gaunt, lonely Lane of Slyre;
   And at whiles behind me, far at sea, a sullen thunder muttered
      As I mounted high and higher.

      Till, the upper roadway quitting,
   I adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed,
   While the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me, earthward
   flitting,
      And an arid wind went past.

      Round about me bulged the barrows
   As before, in antique silence—immemorial funeral piles—
   Where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flint-tipt arrows
      Mid the thyme and chamomiles;

      And the Sarsen stone there, dateless,
   On whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender vow,
   Held the heat of yester sun, as sank thereon one fated mateless
      From those far fond hours till now.

      Maybe flustered by my presence
   Rose the peewits, just as all those years back, wailing soft and loud,
   And revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence
      Up against the cope of cloud,

      Where their dolesome exclamations
   Seemed the voicings of the self-same throats I had heard when life was
   green,
   Though since that day uncounted frail forgotten generations
      Of their kind had flecked the scene.—

      And so, living long and longer
   In a past that lived no more, my eyes discerned there, suddenly,
   That a figure broke the skyline—first in vague contour, then stronger,
      And was crossing near to me.

      Some long-missed familiar gesture,
   Something wonted, struck me in the figure’s pause to list and heed,
   Till I fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping vesture
      That it might be She indeed.

      ’Twas not reasonless: below there
   In the vale, had been her home; the nook might hold her even yet,
   And the downlands were her father’s fief; she still might come and go
   there;—
      So I rose, and said, “Agnette!”

      With a little leap, half-frightened,
   She withdrew some steps; then letting intuition smother fear
   In a place so long-accustomed, and as one whom thought enlightened,
      She replied: “What—_that_ voice?—here!”

      “Yes, Agnette!—And did the occasion
   Of our marching hither make you think I _might_ walk where we two—”
   “O, I often come,” she murmured with a moment’s coy evasion,
      “(’Tis not far),—and—think of you.”

      Then I took her hand, and led her
   To the ancient people’s stone whereon I had sat.  There now sat we;
   And together talked, until the first reluctant shyness fled her,
      And she spoke confidingly.

      “It is _just_ as ere we parted!”
   Said she, brimming high with joy.—“And when, then, came you here, and
   why?”
   “—Dear, I could not sleep for thinking of our trystings when
   twin-hearted.”
      She responded, “Nor could I.

      “There are few things I would rather
   Than be wandering at this spirit-hour—lone-lived, my kindred dead—
   On this wold of well-known feature I inherit from my father:
      Night or day, I have no dread . . .

      “O I wonder, wonder whether
   Any heartstring bore a signal-thrill between us twain or no?—
   Some such influence can, at times, they say, draw severed souls
   together.”
      I said, “Dear, we’ll dream it so.”

      Each one’s hand the other’s grasping,
   And a mutual forgiveness won, we sank to silent thought,
   A large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping,
      And contracting years to nought.

      Till I, maybe overweary
   From the lateness, and a wayfaring so full of strain and stress
   For one no longer buoyant, to a peak so steep and eery,
      Sank to slow unconsciousness . . .

      How long I slept I knew not,
   But the brief warm summer night had slid when, to my swift surprise,
   A red upedging sun, of glory chambered mortals view not,
      Was blazing on my eyes,

      From the Milton Woods to Dole-Hill
   All the spacious landscape lighting, and around about my feet
   Flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and
   mole-hill,
      And on trails the ewes had beat.

      She was sitting still beside me,
   Dozing likewise; and I turned to her, to take her hanging hand;
   When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook and tried me
      In her image then I scanned;

      That which Time’s transforming chisel
   Had been tooling night and day for twenty years, and tooled too well,
   In its rendering of crease where curve was, where was raven, grizzle—
      Pits, where peonies once did dwell.

      She had wakened, and perceiving
   (I surmise) my sigh and shock, my quite involuntary dismay,
   Up she started, and—her wasted figure all throughout it heaving—
      Said, “Ah, yes: I am _thus_ by day!

      “Can you really wince and wonder
   That the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and bone,
   As if unaware a Death’s-head must of need lie not far under
      Flesh whose years out-count your own?

      “Yes: that movement was a warning
   Of the worth of man’s devotion!—Yes, Sir, I am _old_,” said she,
   “And the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into
   scorning—
      And your new-won heart from me!”

      Then she went, ere I could call her,
   With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before,
   And I saw her form descend the slopes, and smaller grow and smaller,
      Till I caught its course no more . . .

      True; I might have dogged her downward;
   —But it _may_ be (though I know not) that this trick on us of Time
   Disconcerted and confused me.—Soon I bent my footsteps townward,
      Like to one who had watched a crime.

      Well I knew my native weakness,
   Well I know it still.  I cherished her reproach like physic-wine,
   For I saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness
      A nobler soul than mine.

      Did I not return, then, ever?—
   Did we meet again?—mend all?—Alas, what greyhead perseveres!—
   Soon I got the Route elsewhither.—Since that hour I have seen her
   never:
      Love is lame at fifty years.



A TRAMPWOMAN’S TRAGEDY
(182–)


                                    I

   FROM Wynyard’s Gap the livelong day,
         The livelong day,
   We beat afoot the northward way
      We had travelled times before.
   The sun-blaze burning on our backs,
   Our shoulders sticking to our packs,
   By fosseway, fields, and turnpike tracks
      We skirted sad Sedge-Moor.

                                    II

   Full twenty miles we jaunted on,
         We jaunted on,—
   My fancy-man, and jeering John,
      And Mother Lee, and I.
   And, as the sun drew down to west,
   We climbed the toilsome Poldon crest,
   And saw, of landskip sights the best,
      The inn that beamed thereby.

                                   III

   For months we had padded side by side,
         Ay, side by side
   Through the Great Forest, Blackmoor wide,
      And where the Parret ran.
   We’d faced the gusts on Mendip ridge,
   Had crossed the Yeo unhelped by bridge,
   Been stung by every Marshwood midge,
      I and my fancy-man.

                                    IV

   Lone inns we loved, my man and I,
         My man and I;
   “King’s Stag,” “Windwhistle” high and dry,
      “The Horse” on Hintock Green,
   The cosy house at Wynyard’s Gap,
   “The Hut” renowned on Bredy Knap,
   And many another wayside tap
      Where folk might sit unseen.

                                    V

   Now as we trudged—O deadly day,
         O deadly day!—
   I teased my fancy-man in play
      And wanton idleness.
   I walked alongside jeering John,
   I laid his hand my waist upon;
   I would not bend my glances on
      My lover’s dark distress.

                                    VI

   Thus Poldon top at last we won,
         At last we won,
   And gained the inn at sink of sun
      Far-famed as “Marshal’s Elm.”
   Beneath us figured tor and lea,
   From Mendip to the western sea—
   I doubt if finer sight there be
      Within this royal realm.

                                   VII

   Inside the settle all a-row—
         All four a-row
   We sat, I next to John, to show
      That he had wooed and won.
   And then he took me on his knee,
   And swore it was his turn to be
   My favoured mate, and Mother Lee
      Passed to my former one.

                                   VIII

   Then in a voice I had never heard,
         I had never heard,
   My only Love to me: “One word,
      My lady, if you please!
   Whose is the child you are like to bear?—
   _His_?  After all my months o’ care?”
   God knows ’twas not!  But, O despair!
      I nodded—still to tease.

                                    IX

   Then up he sprung, and with his knife—
         And with his knife
   He let out jeering Johnny’s life,
      Yes; there, at set of sun.
   The slant ray through the window nigh
   Gilded John’s blood and glazing eye,
   Ere scarcely Mother Lee and I
      Knew that the deed was done.

                                    X

   The taverns tell the gloomy tale,
         The gloomy tale,
   How that at Ivel-chester jail
      My Love, my sweetheart swung;
   Though stained till now by no misdeed
   Save one horse ta’en in time o’ need;
   (Blue Jimmy stole right many a steed
      Ere his last fling he flung.)

                                    XI

   Thereaft I walked the world alone,
         Alone, alone!
   On his death-day I gave my groan
      And dropt his dead-born child.
   ’Twas nigh the jail, beneath a tree,
   None tending me; for Mother Lee
   Had died at Glaston, leaving me
      Unfriended on the wild.

                                   XII

   And in the night as I lay weak,
         As I lay weak,
   The leaves a-falling on my cheek,
      The red moon low declined—
   The ghost of him I’d die to kiss
   Rose up and said: “Ah, tell me this!
   Was the child mine, or was it his?
      Speak, that I rest may find!”

                                   XIII

   O doubt not but I told him then,
         I told him then,
   That I had kept me from all men
      Since we joined lips and swore.
   Whereat he smiled, and thinned away
   As the wind stirred to call up day . . .
   —’Tis past!  And here alone I stray
      Haunting the Western Moor.

NOTES.—“Windwhistle” (Stanza iv.).  The highness and dryness of
Windwhistle Inn was impressed upon the writer two or three years ago,
when, after climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which
it stands and entering the inn for tea, he was informed by the landlady
that none could be had, unless he would fetch water from a valley half a
mile off, the house containing not a drop, owing to its situation.
However, a tantalizing row of full barrels behind her back testified to a
wetness of a certain sort, which was not at that time desired.

“Marshal’s Elm” (Stanza vi.) so picturesquely situated, is no longer an
inn, though the house, or part of it, still remains.  It used to exhibit
a fine old swinging sign.

“Blue Jimmy” (Stanza x.) was a notorious horse-stealer of Wessex in those
days, who appropriated more than a hundred horses before he was caught,
among others one belonging to a neighbour of the writer’s grandfather.
He was hanged at the now demolished Ivel-chester or Ilchester jail above
mentioned—that building formerly of so many sinister associations in the
minds of the local peasantry, and the continual haunt of fever, which at
last led to its condemnation.  Its site is now an innocent-looking green
meadow.

_April_ 1902.



THE TWO ROSALINDS


                                    I

      THE dubious daylight ended,
   And I walked the Town alone, unminding whither bound and why,
   As from each gaunt street and gaping square a mist of light ascended
      And dispersed upon the sky.

                                    II

      Files of evanescent faces
   Passed each other without heeding, in their travail, teen, or joy,
   Some in void unvisioned listlessness inwrought with pallid traces
      Of keen penury’s annoy.

                                   III

      Nebulous flames in crystal cages
   Leered as if with discontent at city movement, murk, and grime,
   And as waiting some procession of great ghosts from bygone ages
      To exalt the ignoble time.

                                    IV

      In a colonnade high-lighted,
   By a thoroughfare where stern utilitarian traffic dinned,
   On a red and white emblazonment of players and parts, I sighted
      The name of “Rosalind,”

                                    V

      And her famous mates of “Arden,”
   Who observed no stricter customs than “the seasons’ difference” bade,
   Who lived with running brooks for books in Nature’s wildwood garden,
      And called idleness their trade . . .

                                    VI

      Now the poster stirred an ember
   Still remaining from my ardours of some forty years before,
   When the selfsame portal on an eve it thrilled me to remember
      A like announcement bore;

                                   VII

      And expectantly I had entered,
   And had first beheld in human mould a Rosalind woo and plead,
   On whose transcendent figuring my speedy soul had centred
      As it had been she indeed . . .

                                   VIII

      So; all other plans discarding,
   I resolved on entrance, bent on seeing what I once had seen,
   And approached the gangway of my earlier knowledge, disregarding
      The tract of time between.

                                    IX

      “The words, sir?” cried a creature
   Hovering mid the shine and shade as ’twixt the live world and the
   tomb;
   But the well-known numbers needed not for me a text or teacher
      To revive and re-illume.

                                    X

      Then the play . . . But how unfitted
   Was _this_ Rosalind!—a mammet quite to me, in memories nurst,
   And with chilling disappointment soon I sought the street I had
   quitted,
      To re-ponder on the first.

                                    XI

      The hag still hawked,—I met her
   Just without the colonnade.  “So you don’t like her, sir?” said she.
   “Ah—_I_ was once that Rosalind!—I acted her—none better—
      Yes—in eighteen sixty-three.

                                   XII

      “Thus I won Orlando to me
   In my then triumphant days when I had charm and maidenhood,
   Now some forty years ago.—I used to say, _Come woo me_, _woo me_!”
      And she struck the attitude.

                                   XIII

      It was when I had gone there nightly;
   And the voice—though raucous now—was yet the old one.—Clear as noon
   My Rosalind was here . . . Thereon the band withinside lightly
      Beat up a merry tune.



A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY
(_circa_ 186–)


   I BORE a daughter flower-fair,
   In Pydel Vale, alas for me;
   I joyed to mother one so rare,
   But dead and gone I now would be.

   Men looked and loved her as she grew,
   And she was won, alas for me;
   She told me nothing, but I knew,
   And saw that sorrow was to be.

   I knew that one had made her thrall,
   A thrall to him, alas for me;
   And then, at last, she told me all,
   And wondered what her end would be.

   She owned that she had loved too well,
   Had loved too well, unhappy she,
   And bore a secret time would tell,
   Though in her shroud she’d sooner be.

   I plodded to her sweetheart’s door
   In Pydel Vale, alas for me:
   I pleaded with him, pleaded sore,
   To save her from her misery.

   He frowned, and swore he could not wed,
   Seven times he swore it could not be;
   “Poverty’s worse than shame,” he said,
   Till all my hope went out of me.

   “I’ve packed my traps to sail the main”—
   Roughly he spake, alas did he—
   “Wessex beholds me not again,
   ’Tis worse than any jail would be!”

   —There was a shepherd whom I knew,
   A subtle man, alas for me:
   I sought him all the pastures through,
   Though better I had ceased to be.

   I traced him by his lantern light,
   And gave him hint, alas for me,
   Of how she found her in the plight
   That is so scorned in Christendie.

   “Is there an herb . . . ?” I asked.  “Or none?”
   Yes, thus I asked him desperately.
   “—There is,” he said; “a certain one . . . ”
   Would he had sworn that none knew he!

   “To-morrow I will walk your way,”
   He hinted low, alas for me.—
   Fieldwards I gazed throughout next day;
   Now fields I never more would see!

   The sunset-shine, as curfew strook,
   As curfew strook beyond the lea,
   Lit his white smock and gleaming crook,
   While slowly he drew near to me.

   He pulled from underneath his smock
   The herb I sought, my curse to be—
   “At times I use it in my flock,”
   He said, and hope waxed strong in me.

   “’Tis meant to balk ill-motherings”—
   (Ill-motherings!  Why should they be?)—
   “If not, would God have sent such things?”
   So spoke the shepherd unto me.

   That night I watched the poppling brew,
   With bended back and hand on knee:
   I stirred it till the dawnlight grew,
   And the wind whiffled wailfully.

   “This scandal shall be slain,” said I,
   “That lours upon her innocency:
   I’ll give all whispering tongues the lie;”—
   But worse than whispers was to be.

   “Here’s physic for untimely fruit,”
   I said to her, alas for me,
   Early that morn in fond salute;
   And in my grave I now would be.

   —Next Sunday came, with sweet church chimes
   In Pydel Vale, alas for me:
   I went into her room betimes;
   No more may such a Sunday be!

   “Mother, instead of rescue nigh,”
   She faintly breathed, alas for me,
   “I feel as I were like to die,
   And underground soon, soon should be.”

   From church that noon the people walked
   In twos and threes, alas for me,
   Showed their new raiment—smiled and talked,
   Though sackcloth-clad I longed to be.

   Came to my door her lover’s friends,
   And cheerly cried, alas for me,
   “Right glad are we he makes amends,
   For never a sweeter bride can be.”

   My mouth dried, as ’twere scorched within,
   Dried at their words, alas for me:
   More and more neighbours crowded in,
   (O why should mothers ever be!)

   “Ha-ha!  Such well-kept news!” laughed they,
   Yes—so they laughed, alas for me.
   “Whose banns were called in church to-day?”—
   Christ, how I wished my soul could flee!

   “Where is she?  O the stealthy miss,”
   Still bantered they, alas for me,
   “To keep a wedding close as this . . .”
   Ay, Fortune worked thus wantonly!

   “But you are pale—you did not know?”
   They archly asked, alas for me,
   I stammered, “Yes—some days-ago,”
   While coffined clay I wished to be.

   “’Twas done to please her, we surmise?”
   (They spoke quite lightly in their glee)
   “Done by him as a fond surprise?”
   I thought their words would madden me.

   Her lover entered.  “Where’s my bird?—
   My bird—my flower—my picotee?
   First time of asking, soon the third!”
   Ah, in my grave I well may be.

   To me he whispered: “Since your call—”
   So spoke he then, alas for me—
   “I’ve felt for her, and righted all.”
   —I think of it to agony.

   “She’s faint to-day—tired—nothing more—”
   Thus did I lie, alas for me . . .
   I called her at her chamber door
   As one who scarce had strength to be.

   No voice replied.  I went within—
   O women! scourged the worst are we . . .
   I shrieked.  The others hastened in
   And saw the stroke there dealt on me.

   There she lay—silent, breathless, dead,
   Stone dead she lay—wronged, sinless she!—
   Ghost-white the cheeks once rosy-red:
   Death had took her.  Death took not me.

   I kissed her colding face and hair,
   I kissed her corpse—the bride to be!—
   My punishment I cannot bear,
   But pray God _not_ to pity me.

_January_ 1904.



THE HOUSE OF HOSPITALITIES


   HERE we broached the Christmas barrel,
      Pushed up the charred log-ends;
   Here we sang the Christmas carol,
         And called in friends.

   Time has tired me since we met here
      When the folk now dead were young,
   Since the viands were outset here
         And quaint songs sung.

   And the worm has bored the viol
      That used to lead the tune,
   Rust eaten out the dial
         That struck night’s noon.

   Now no Christmas brings in neighbours,
      And the New Year comes unlit;
   Where we sang the mole now labours,
         And spiders knit.

   Yet at midnight if here walking,
      When the moon sheets wall and tree,
   I see forms of old time talking,
         Who smile on me.



BEREFT


      IN the black winter morning
   No light will be struck near my eyes
   While the clock in the stairway is warning
   For five, when he used to rise.
         Leave the door unbarred,
         The clock unwound,
         Make my lone bed hard—
         Would ’twere underground!

      When the summer dawns clearly,
   And the appletree-tops seem alight,
   Who will undraw the curtain and cheerly
   Call out that the morning is bright?

      When I tarry at market
   No form will cross Durnover Lea
   In the gathering darkness, to hark at
   Grey’s Bridge for the pit-pat o’ me.

      When the supper crock’s steaming,
   And the time is the time of his tread,
   I shall sit by the fire and wait dreaming
   In a silence as of the dead.
         Leave the door unbarred,
         The clock unwound,
         Make my lone bed hard—
         Would ’twere underground!

1901.



JOHN AND JANE


                                    I

   HE sees the world as a boisterous place
   Where all things bear a laughing face,
   And humorous scenes go hourly on,
      Does John.

                                    II

   They find the world a pleasant place
   Where all is ecstasy and grace,
   Where a light has risen that cannot wane,
      Do John and Jane.

                                   III

   They see as a palace their cottage-place,
   Containing a pearl of the human race,
   A hero, maybe, hereafter styled,
      Do John and Jane with a baby-child.

                                    IV

   They rate the world as a gruesome place,
   Where fair looks fade to a skull’s grimace,—
   As a pilgrimage they would fain get done—
      Do John and Jane with their worthless son.



THE CURATE’S KINDNESS
A WORKHOUSE IRONY


                                    I

   I THOUGHT they’d be strangers aroun’ me,
      But she’s to be there!
   Let me jump out o’ waggon and go back and drown me
   At Pummery or Ten-Hatches Weir.

                                    II

   I thought: “Well, I’ve come to the Union—
      The workhouse at last—
   After honest hard work all the week, and Communion
   O’ Zundays, these fifty years past.

                                   III

   “’Tis hard; but,” I thought, “never mind it:
      There’s gain in the end:
   And when I get used to the place I shall find it
      A home, and may find there a friend.

                                    IV

   “Life there will be better than t’other.
      For peace is assured.
   _The men in one wing and their wives in another_
      Is strictly the rule of the Board.”

                                    V

   Just then one young Pa’son arriving
      Steps up out of breath
   To the side o’ the waggon wherein we were driving
      To Union; and calls out and saith:

                                    VI

   “Old folks, that harsh order is altered,
      Be not sick of heart!
   The Guardians they poohed and they pished and they paltered
      When urged not to keep you apart.

                                   VII

   “‘It is wrong,’ I maintained, ‘to divide them,
      Near forty years wed.’
   ‘Very well, sir.  We promise, then, they shall abide them
      In one wing together,’ they said.”

                                   VIII

   Then I sank—knew ’twas quite a foredone thing
      That misery should be
   To the end! . . . To get freed of her there was the one thing
      Had made the change welcome to me.

                                    IX

   To go there was ending but badly;
      ’Twas shame and ’twas pain;
   “But anyhow,” thought I, “thereby I shall gladly
      Get free of this forty years’ chain.”

                                    X

   I thought they’d be strangers aroun’ me,
      But she’s to be there!
   Let me jump out o’ waggon and go back and drown me
      At Pummery or Ten-Hatches Weir.



THE FLIRT’S TRAGEDY
(17–)


   HERE alone by the logs in my chamber,
      Deserted, decrepit—
   Spent flames limning ghosts on the wainscot
      Of friends I once knew—

   My drama and hers begins weirdly
      Its dumb re-enactment,
   Each scene, sigh, and circumstance passing
      In spectral review.

   —Wealth was mine beyond wish when I met her—
      The pride of the lowland—
   Embowered in Tintinhull Valley
      By laurel and yew;

   And love lit my soul, notwithstanding
      My features’ ill favour,
   Too obvious beside her perfections
      Of line and of hue.

   But it pleased her to play on my passion,
      And whet me to pleadings
   That won from her mirthful negations
      And scornings undue.

   Then I fled her disdains and derisions
      To cities of pleasure,
   And made me the crony of idlers
      In every purlieu.

   Of those who lent ear to my story,
      A needy Adonis
   Gave hint how to grizzle her garden
      From roses to rue,

   Could his price but be paid for so purging
      My scorner of scornings:
   Thus tempted, the lust to avenge me
      Germed inly and grew.

   I clothed him in sumptuous apparel,
      Consigned to him coursers,
   Meet equipage, liveried attendants
      In full retinue.

   So dowered, with letters of credit
      He wayfared to England,
   And spied out the manor she goddessed,
      And handy thereto,

   Set to hire him a tenantless mansion
      As coign-stone of vantage
   For testing what gross adulation
      Of beauty could do.

   He laboured through mornings and evens,
      On new moons and sabbaths,
   By wiles to enmesh her attention
      In park, path, and pew;

   And having afar played upon her,
      Advanced his lines nearer,
   And boldly outleaping conventions,
      Bent briskly to woo.

   His gay godlike face, his rare seeming
      Anon worked to win her,
   And later, at noontides and night-tides
      They held rendezvous.

   His tarriance full spent, he departed
      And met me in Venice,
   And lines from her told that my jilter
      Was stooping to sue.

   Not long could be further concealment,
      She pled to him humbly:
   “By our love and our sin, O protect me;
      I fly unto you!”

   A mighty remorse overgat me,
      I heard her low anguish,
   And there in the gloom of the _calle_
      My steel ran him through.

   A swift push engulphed his hot carrion
      Within the canal there—
   That still street of waters dividing
      The city in two.

   —I wandered awhile all unable
      To smother my torment,
   My brain racked by yells as from Tophet
      Of Satan’s whole crew.

   A month of unrest brought me hovering
      At home in her precincts,
   To whose hiding-hole local story
      Afforded a clue.

   Exposed, and expelled by her people,
      Afar off in London
   I found her alone, in a sombre
      And soul-stifling mew.

   Still burning to make reparation
      I pleaded to wive her,
   And father her child, and thus faintly
      My mischief undo.

   She yielded, and spells of calm weather
      Succeeded the tempest;
   And one sprung of him stood as scion
      Of my bone and thew . . .

   But Time unveils sorrows and secrets,
      And so it befell now:
   By inches the curtain was twitched at,
      And slowly undrew.

   As we lay, she and I, in the night-time,
      We heard the boy moaning:
   “O misery mine!  My false father
      Has murdered my true!”

   She gasped: yea, she heard; understood it.
      Next day the child fled us;
   And nevermore sighted was even
      A print of his shoe.

   Thenceforward she shunned me, and languished;
      Till one day the park-pool
   Embraced her fair form, and extinguished
      Her eyes’ living blue.

   —So; ask not what blast may account for
      This aspect of pallor,
   These bones that just prison within them
      Life’s poor residue;

   But pass by, and leave unregarded
      A Cain to his suffering,
   For vengeance too dark on the woman
      Whose lover he slew.



THE REJECTED MEMBER’S WIFE


   WE shall see her no more
      On the balcony,
   Smiling, while hurt, at the roar
      As of surging sea
   From the stormy sturdy band
      Who have doomed her lord’s cause,
   Though she waves her little hand
      As it were applause.

   Here will be candidates yet,
      And candidates’ wives,
   Fervid with zeal to set
      Their ideals on our lives:
   Here will come market-men
      On the market-days,
   Here will clash now and then
      More such party assays.

   And the balcony will fill
      When such times are renewed,
   And the throng in the street will thrill
      With to-day’s mettled mood;
   But she will no more stand
      In the sunshine there,
   With that wave of her white-gloved hand,
      And that chestnut hair.

_January_ 1906.



THE FARM-WOMAN’S WINTER


                                    I

   If seasons all were summers,
      And leaves would never fall,
   And hopping casement-comers
      Were foodless not at all,
   And fragile folk might be here
      That white winds bid depart;
   Then one I used to see here
      Would warm my wasted heart!

                                    II

   One frail, who, bravely tilling
      Long hours in gripping gusts,
   Was mastered by their chilling,
      And now his ploughshare rusts.
   So savage winter catches
      The breath of limber things,
   And what I love he snatches,
      And what I love not, brings.



AUTUMN IN KING’S
HINTOCK PARK


   HERE by the baring bough
      Raking up leaves,
   Often I ponder how
      Springtime deceives,—
   I, an old woman now,
      Raking up leaves.

   Here in the avenue
      Raking up leaves,
   Lords’ ladies pass in view,
      Until one heaves
   Sighs at life’s russet hue,
      Raking up leaves!

   Just as my shape you see
      Raking up leaves,
   I saw, when fresh and free,
      Those memory weaves
   Into grey ghosts by me,
      Raking up leaves.

   Yet, Dear, though one may sigh,
      Raking up leaves,
   New leaves will dance on high—
      Earth never grieves!—
   Will not, when missed am I
      Raking up leaves.

1901.



SHUT OUT THAT MOON


   CLOSE up the casement, draw the blind,
      Shut out that stealing moon,
   She wears too much the guise she wore
      Before our lutes were strewn
   With years-deep dust, and names we read
      On a white stone were hewn.

   Step not out on the dew-dashed lawn
      To view the Lady’s Chair,
   Immense Orion’s glittering form,
      The Less and Greater Bear:
   Stay in; to such sights we were drawn
      When faded ones were fair.

   Brush not the bough for midnight scents
      That come forth lingeringly,
   And wake the same sweet sentiments
      They breathed to you and me
   When living seemed a laugh, and love
      All it was said to be.

   Within the common lamp-lit room
      Prison my eyes and thought;
   Let dingy details crudely loom,
      Mechanic speech be wrought:
   Too fragrant was Life’s early bloom,
      Too tart the fruit it brought!

1904.



REMINISCENCES OF A DANCING MAN


                                    I

   WHO now remembers Almack’s balls—
      Willis’s sometime named—
   In those two smooth-floored upper halls
      For faded ones so famed?
   Where as we trod to trilling sound
   The fancied phantoms stood around,
      Or joined us in the maze,
   Of the powdered Dears from Georgian years,
   Whose dust lay in sightless sealed-up biers,
      The fairest of former days.

                                    II

   Who now remembers gay Cremorne,
      And all its jaunty jills,
   And those wild whirling figures born
      Of Jullien’s grand quadrilles?
   With hats on head and morning coats
   There footed to his prancing notes
      Our partner-girls and we;
   And the gas-jets winked, and the lustres clinked,
   And the platform throbbed as with arms enlinked
      We moved to the minstrelsy.

                                   III

   Who now recalls those crowded rooms
      Of old yclept “The Argyle,”
   Where to the deep Drum-polka’s booms
      We hopped in standard style?
   Whither have danced those damsels now!
   Is Death the partner who doth moue
      Their wormy chaps and bare?
   Do their spectres spin like sparks within
   The smoky halls of the Prince of Sin
      To a thunderous Jullien air?



THE DEAD MAN WALKING


   THEY hail me as one living,
      But don’t they know
   That I have died of late years,
      Untombed although?

   I am but a shape that stands here,
      A pulseless mould,
   A pale past picture, screening
      Ashes gone cold.

   Not at a minute’s warning,
      Not in a loud hour,
   For me ceased Time’s enchantments
      In hall and bower.

   There was no tragic transit,
      No catch of breath,
   When silent seasons inched me
      On to this death . . .

   —A Troubadour-youth I rambled
      With Life for lyre,
   The beats of being raging
      In me like fire.

   But when I practised eyeing
      The goal of men,
   It iced me, and I perished
      A little then.

   When passed my friend, my kinsfolk
      Through the Last Door,
   And left me standing bleakly,
      I died yet more;

   And when my Love’s heart kindled
      In hate of me,
   Wherefore I knew not, died I
      One more degree.

   And if when I died fully
      I cannot say,
   And changed into the corpse-thing
      I am to-day;

   Yet is it that, though whiling
      The time somehow
   In walking, talking, smiling,
      I live not now.




MORE LOVE LYRICS


1967


   IN five-score summers!  All new eyes,
   New minds, new modes, new fools, new wise;
   New woes to weep, new joys to prize;

   With nothing left of me and you
   In that live century’s vivid view
   Beyond a pinch of dust or two;

   A century which, if not sublime,
   Will show, I doubt not, at its prime,
   A scope above this blinkered time.

   —Yet what to me how far above?
   For I would only ask thereof
   That thy worm should be my worm, Love!

16 WESTBOURNE PARK VILLAS, 1867.



HER DEFINITION


   I LINGERED through the night to break of day,
   Nor once did sleep extend a wing to me,
   Intently busied with a vast array
   Of epithets that should outfigure thee.

   Full-featured terms—all fitless—hastened by,
   And this sole speech remained: “That maiden mine!”—
   Debarred from due description then did I
   Perceive the indefinite phrase could yet define.

   As common chests encasing wares of price
   Are borne with tenderness through halls of state,
   For what they cover, so the poor device
   Of homely wording I could tolerate,
   Knowing its unadornment held as freight
   The sweetest image outside Paradise.

W. P. V.,
Summer: 1866.



THE DIVISION


   RAIN on the windows, creaking doors,
      With blasts that besom the green,
   And I am here, and you are there,
      And a hundred miles between!

   O were it but the weather, Dear,
      O were it but the miles
   That summed up all our severance,
      There might be room for smiles.

   But that thwart thing betwixt us twain,
      Which nothing cleaves or clears,
   Is more than distance, Dear, or rain,
      And longer than the years!

1893.



ON THE DEPARTURE PLATFORM


   WE kissed at the barrier; and passing through
   She left me, and moment by moment got
   Smaller and smaller, until to my view
      She was but a spot;

   A wee white spot of muslin fluff
   That down the diminishing platform bore
   Through hustling crowds of gentle and rough
      To the carriage door.

   Under the lamplight’s fitful glowers,
   Behind dark groups from far and near,
   Whose interests were apart from ours,
      She would disappear,

   Then show again, till I ceased to see
   That flexible form, that nebulous white;
   And she who was more than my life to me
      Had vanished quite . . .

   We have penned new plans since that fair fond day,
   And in season she will appear again—
   Perhaps in the same soft white array—
      But never as then!

   —“And why, young man, must eternally fly
   A joy you’ll repeat, if you love her well?”
   —O friend, nought happens twice thus; why,
      I cannot tell!



IN A CATHEDRAL CITY


   THESE people have not heard your name;
   No loungers in this placid place
   Have helped to bruit your beauty’s fame.

   The grey Cathedral, towards whose face
   Bend eyes untold, has met not yours;
   Your shade has never swept its base,

   Your form has never darked its doors,
   Nor have your faultless feet once thrown
   A pensive pit-pat on its floors.

   Along the street to maids well known
   Blithe lovers hum their tender airs,
   But in your praise voice not a tone.

   —Since nought bespeaks you here, or bears,
   As I, your imprint through and through,
   Here might I rest, till my heart shares
   The spot’s unconsciousness of you!

SALISBURY.



“I SAY I’LL SEEK HER”


   I SAY, “I’ll seek her side
      Ere hindrance interposes;”
      But eve in midnight closes,
   And here I still abide.

   When darkness wears I see
      Her sad eyes in a vision;
      They ask, “What indecision
   Detains you, Love, from me?—

   “The creaking hinge is oiled,
      I have unbarred the backway,
      But you tread not the trackway;
   And shall the thing be spoiled?

   “Far cockcrows echo shrill,
      The shadows are abating,
      And I am waiting, waiting;
   But O, you tarry still!”



HER FATHER


   I MET her, as we had privily planned,
   Where passing feet beat busily:
   She whispered: “Father is at hand!
      He wished to walk with me.”

   His presence as he joined us there
   Banished our words of warmth away;
   We felt, with cloudings of despair,
      What Love must lose that day.

   Her crimson lips remained unkissed,
   Our fingers kept no tender hold,
   His lack of feeling made the tryst
      Embarrassed, stiff, and cold.

   A cynic ghost then rose and said,
   “But is his love for her so small
   That, nigh to yours, it may be read
      As of no worth at all?

   “You love her for her pink and white;
   But what when their fresh splendours close?
   His love will last her in despite
      Of Time, and wrack, and foes.”

WEYMOUTH.



AT WAKING


      WHEN night was lifting,
   And dawn had crept under its shade,
      Amid cold clouds drifting
   Dead-white as a corpse outlaid,
         With a sudden scare
         I seemed to behold
         My Love in bare
         Hard lines unfold.

      Yea, in a moment,
   An insight that would not die
      Killed her old endowment
   Of charm that had capped all nigh,
         Which vanished to none
         Like the gilt of a cloud,
         And showed her but one
         Of the common crowd.

      She seemed but a sample
   Of earth’s poor average kind,
      Lit up by no ample
   Enrichments of mien or mind.
         I covered my eyes
         As to cover the thought,
         And unrecognize
         What the morn had taught.

      O vision appalling
   When the one believed-in thing
      Is seen falling, falling,
   With all to which hope can cling.
         Off: it is not true;
         For it cannot be
         That the prize I drew
         Is a blank to me!

WEYMOUTH, 1869.



FOUR FOOTPRINTS


   HERE are the tracks upon the sand
   Where stood last evening she and I—
   Pressed heart to heart and hand to hand;
   The morning sun has baked them dry.

   I kissed her wet face—wet with rain,
   For arid grief had burnt up tears,
   While reached us as in sleeping pain
   The distant gurgling of the weirs.

   “I have married him—yes; feel that ring;
   ’Tis a week ago that he put it on . . .
   A dutiful daughter does this thing,
   And resignation succeeds anon!

   “But that I body and soul was yours
   Ere he’d possession, he’ll never know.
   He’s a confident man.  ‘The husband scores,’
   He says, ‘in the long run’ . . . Now, Dear, go!”

   I went.  And to-day I pass the spot;
   It is only a smart the more to endure;
   And she whom I held is as though she were not,
   For they have resumed their honeymoon tour.



IN THE VAULTED WAY


   IN the vaulted way, where the passage turned
   To the shadowy corner that none could see,
   You paused for our parting,—plaintively;
   Though overnight had come words that burned
   My fond frail happiness out of me.

   And then I kissed you,—despite my thought
   That our spell must end when reflection came
   On what you had deemed me, whose one long aim
   Had been to serve you; that what I sought
   Lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame.

   But yet I kissed you; whereon you again
   As of old kissed me.  Why, why was it so?
   Do you cleave to me after that light-tongued blow?
   If you scorned me at eventide, how love then?
   The thing is dark, Dear.  I do not know.



IN THE MIND’S EYE


   THAT was once her casement,
      And the taper nigh,
   Shining from within there,
      Beckoned, “Here am I!”

   Now, as then, I see her
      Moving at the pane;
   Ah; ’tis but her phantom
      Borne within my brain!—

   Foremost in my vision
      Everywhere goes she;
   Change dissolves the landscapes,
      She abides with me.

   Shape so sweet and shy, Dear,
      Who can say thee nay?
   Never once do I, Dear,
      Wish thy ghost away.



THE END OF THE EPISODE


      INDULGE no more may we
   In this sweet-bitter pastime:
   The love-light shines the last time
      Between you, Dear, and me.

      There shall remain no trace
   Of what so closely tied us,
   And blank as ere love eyed us
      Will be our meeting-place.

      The flowers and thymy air,
   Will they now miss our coming?
   The dumbles thin their humming
      To find we haunt not there?

      Though fervent was our vow,
   Though ruddily ran our pleasure,
   Bliss has fulfilled its measure,
      And sees its sentence now.

      Ache deep; but make no moans:
   Smile out; but stilly suffer:
   The paths of love are rougher
      Than thoroughfares of stones.



THE SIGH


   LITTLE head against my shoulder,
   Shy at first, then somewhat bolder,
      And up-eyed;
   Till she, with a timid quaver,
   Yielded to the kiss I gave her;
      But, she sighed.

   That there mingled with her feeling
   Some sad thought she was concealing
      It implied.
   —Not that she had ceased to love me,
   None on earth she set above me;
      But she sighed.

   She could not disguise a passion,
   Dread, or doubt, in weakest fashion
      If she tried:
   Nothing seemed to hold us sundered,
   Hearts were victors; so I wondered
      Why she sighed.

   Afterwards I knew her throughly,
   And she loved me staunchly, truly,
      Till she died;
   But she never made confession
   Why, at that first sweet concession,
      She had sighed.

   It was in our May, remember;
   And though now I near November,
      And abide
   Till my appointed change, unfretting,
   Sometimes I sit half regretting
      That she sighed.



“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”


   I TOLD her when I left one day
   That whatsoever weight of care
   Might strain our love, Time’s mere assault
      Would work no changes there.
   And in the night she came to me,
      Toothless, and wan, and old,
   With leaden concaves round her eyes,
      And wrinkles manifold.

   I tremblingly exclaimed to her,
   “O wherefore do you ghost me thus!
   I have said that dull defacing Time
      Will bring no dreads to us.”
   “And is that true of _you_?” she cried
      In voice of troubled tune.
   I faltered: “Well . . . I did not think
      You would test me quite so soon!”

   She vanished with a curious smile,
   Which told me, plainlier than by word,
   That my staunch pledge could scarce beguile
      The fear she had averred.
   Her doubts then wrought their shape in me,
      And when next day I paid
   My due caress, we seemed to be
      Divided by some shade.



THE CONFORMERS


      YES; we’ll wed, my little fay,
      And you shall write you mine,
   And in a villa chastely gray
      We’ll house, and sleep, and dine.
      But those night-screened, divine,
      Stolen trysts of heretofore,
   We of choice ecstasies and fine
         Shall know no more.

      The formal faced cohue
      Will then no more upbraid
   With smiting smiles and whisperings two
      Who have thrown less loves in shade.
      We shall no more evade
      The searching light of the sun,
   Our game of passion will be played,
         Our dreaming done.

      We shall not go in stealth
      To rendezvous unknown,
   But friends will ask me of your health,
      And you about my own.
      When we abide alone,
      No leapings each to each,
   But syllables in frigid tone
         Of household speech.

      When down to dust we glide
      Men will not say askance,
   As now: “How all the country side
      Rings with their mad romance!”
      But as they graveward glance
      Remark: “In them we lose
   A worthy pair, who helped advance
         Sound parish views.”



THE DAWN AFTER THE DANCE


   HERE is your parents’ dwelling with its curtained windows telling
   Of no thought of us within it or of our arrival here;
   Their slumbers have been normal after one day more of formal
   Matrimonial commonplace and household life’s mechanic gear.

   I would be candid willingly, but dawn draws on so chillingly
   As to render further cheerlessness intolerable now,
   So I will not stand endeavouring to declare a day for severing,
   But will clasp you just as always—just the olden love avow.

   Through serene and surly weather we have walked the ways together,
   And this long night’s dance this year’s end eve now finishes the
   spell;
   Yet we dreamt us but beginning a sweet sempiternal spinning
   Of a cord we have spun to breaking—too intemperately, too well.

   Yes; last night we danced I know, Dear, as we did that year ago, Dear,
   When a new strange bond between our days was formed, and felt, and
   heard;
   Would that dancing were the worst thing from the latest to the first
   thing
   That the faded year can charge us with; but what avails a word!

   That which makes man’s love the lighter and the woman’s burn no
   brighter
   Came to pass with us inevitably while slipped the shortening year . .
   .
   And there stands your father’s dwelling with its blind bleak windows
   telling
   That the vows of man and maid are frail as filmy gossamere.

WEYMOUTH, 1869.



THE SUN ON THE LETTER


   I DREW the letter out, while gleamed
   The sloping sun from under a roof
   Of cloud whose verge rose visibly.

   The burning ball flung rays that seemed
   Stretched like a warp without a woof
   Across the levels of the lea

   To where I stood, and where they beamed
   As brightly on the page of proof
   That she had shown her false to me

   As if it had shown her true—had teemed
   With passionate thought for my behoof
   Expressed with their own ardency!



THE NIGHT OF THE DANCE


   THE cold moon hangs to the sky by its horn,
      And centres its gaze on me;
   The stars, like eyes in reverie,
   Their westering as for a while forborne,
      Quiz downward curiously.

   Old Robert draws the backbrand in,
      The green logs steam and spit;
   The half-awakened sparrows flit
   From the riddled thatch; and owls begin
      To whoo from the gable-slit.

   Yes; far and nigh things seem to know
      Sweet scenes are impending here;
   That all is prepared; that the hour is near
   For welcomes, fellowships, and flow
      Of sally, song, and cheer;

   That spigots are pulled and viols strung;
      That soon will arise the sound
   Of measures trod to tunes renowned;
   That She will return in Love’s low tongue
      My vows as we wheel around.



MISCONCEPTION


   I BUSIED myself to find a sure
         Snug hermitage
   That should preserve my Love secure
         From the world’s rage;
   Where no unseemly saturnals,
      Or strident traffic-roars,
   Or hum of intervolved cabals
      Should echo at her doors.

   I laboured that the diurnal spin
         Of vanities
   Should not contrive to suck her in
         By dark degrees,
   And cunningly operate to blur
      Sweet teachings I had begun;
   And then I went full-heart to her
      To expound the glad deeds done.

   She looked at me, and said thereto
         With a pitying smile,
   “And _this_ is what has busied you
         So long a while?
   O poor exhausted one, I see
      You have worn you old and thin
   For naught!  Those moils you fear for me
      I find most pleasure in!”



THE VOICE OF THE THORN


                                    I

   WHEN the thorn on the down
   Quivers naked and cold,
   And the mid-aged and old
   Pace the path there to town,
   In these words dry and drear
   It seems to them sighing:
   “O winter is trying
   To sojourners here!”

                                    II

   When it stands fully tressed
   On a hot summer day,
   And the ewes there astray
   Find its shade a sweet rest,
   By the breath of the breeze
   It inquires of each farer:
   “Who would not be sharer
   Of shadow with these?”

                                   III

   But by day or by night,
   And in winter or summer,
   Should I be the comer
   Along that lone height,
   In its voicing to me
   Only one speech is spoken:
   “Here once was nigh broken
   A heart, and by thee.”



FROM HER IN THE COUNTRY


   I THOUGHT and thought of thy crass clanging town
   To folly, till convinced such dreams were ill,
   I held my heart in bond, and tethered down
   Fancy to where I was, by force of will.

   I said: How beautiful are these flowers, this wood,
   One little bud is far more sweet to me
   Than all man’s urban shows; and then I stood
   Urging new zest for bird, and bush, and tree;

   And strove to feel my nature brought it forth
   Of instinct, or no rural maid was I;
   But it was vain; for I could not see worth
   Enough around to charm a midge or fly,

   And mused again on city din and sin,
   Longing to madness I might move therein!

16 W. P. V., 1866.



HER CONFESSION


   AS some bland soul, to whom a debtor says
   “I’ll now repay the amount I owe to you,”
   In inward gladness feigns forgetfulness
   That such a payment ever was his due

   (His long thought notwithstanding), so did I
   At our last meeting waive your proffered kiss
   With quick divergent talk of scenery nigh,
   By such suspension to enhance my bliss.

   And as his looks in consternation fall
   When, gathering that the debt is lightly deemed,
   The debtor makes as not to pay at all,
   So faltered I, when your intention seemed

   Converted by my false uneagerness
   To putting off for ever the caress.

W. P. V., 1865–67.



TO AN IMPERSONATOR OF ROSALIND


   DID he who drew her in the years ago—
   Till now conceived creator of her grace—
   With telescopic sight high natures know,
   Discern remote in Time’s untravelled space

   Your soft sweet mien, your gestures, as do we,
   And with a copyist’s hand but set them down,
   Glowing yet more to dream our ecstasy
   When his Original should be forthshown?

   For, kindled by that animated eye,
   Whereto all fairnesses about thee brim,
   And by thy tender tones, what wight can fly
   The wild conviction welling up in him

   That he at length beholds woo, parley, plead,
   The “very, very Rosalind” indeed!

8 ADELPHI TERRACE, 21_st_ _April_ 1867.



TO AN ACTRESS


   I READ your name when you were strange to me,
   Where it stood blazoned bold with many more;
   I passed it vacantly, and did not see
   Any great glory in the shape it wore.

   O cruelty, the insight barred me then!
   Why did I not possess me with its sound,
   And in its cadence catch and catch again
   Your nature’s essence floating therearound?

   Could _that_ man be this I, unknowing you,
   When now the knowing you is all of me,
   And the old world of then is now a new,
   And purpose no more what it used to be—
   A thing of formal journeywork, but due
   To springs that then were sealed up utterly?

1867.



THE MINUTE BEFORE MEETING


   THE grey gaunt days dividing us in twain
   Seemed hopeless hills my strength must faint to climb,
   But they are gone; and now I would detain
   The few clock-beats that part us; rein back Time,

   And live in close expectance never closed
   In change for far expectance closed at last,
   So harshly has expectance been imposed
   On my long need while these slow blank months passed.

   And knowing that what is now about to be
   Will all _have been_ in O, so short a space!
   I read beyond it my despondency
   When more dividing months shall take its place,
   Thereby denying to this hour of grace
   A full-up measure of felicity.

1871.



HE ABJURES LOVE


   AT last I put off love,
      For twice ten years
   The daysman of my thought,
      And hope, and doing;
   Being ashamed thereof,
      And faint of fears
   And desolations, wrought
   In his pursuing,

   Since first in youthtime those
      Disquietings
   That heart-enslavement brings
      To hale and hoary,
   Became my housefellows,
      And, fool and blind,
   I turned from kith and kind
      To give him glory.

   I was as children be
      Who have no care;
   I did not shrink or sigh,
      I did not sicken;
   But lo, Love beckoned me,
      And I was bare,
   And poor, and starved, and dry,
      And fever-stricken.

   Too many times ablaze
      With fatuous fires,
   Enkindled by his wiles
      To new embraces,
   Did I, by wilful ways
      And baseless ires,
   Return the anxious smiles
      Of friendly faces.

   No more will now rate I
      The common rare,
   The midnight drizzle dew,
      The gray hour golden,
   The wind a yearning cry,
      The faulty fair,
   Things dreamt, of comelier hue
      Than things beholden! . . .

   —I speak as one who plumbs
      Life’s dim profound,
   One who at length can sound
      Clear views and certain.
   But—after love what comes?
      A scene that lours,
   A few sad vacant hours,
      And then, the Curtain.

1883.




A SET OF COUNTRY SONGS


LET ME ENJOY


                               (MINOR KEY)

                                    I

   LET me enjoy the earth no less
   Because the all-enacting Might
   That fashioned forth its loveliness
   Had other aims than my delight.

                                    II

   About my path there flits a Fair,
   Who throws me not a word or sign;
   I’ll charm me with her ignoring air,
   And laud the lips not meant for mine.

                                   III

   From manuscripts of moving song
   Inspired by scenes and dreams unknown
   I’ll pour out raptures that belong
   To others, as they were my own.

                                    IV

   And some day hence, towards Paradise,
   And all its blest—if such should be—
   I will lift glad, afar-off eyes,
   Though it contain no place for me.



AT CASTERBRIDGE FAIR


I
The Ballad-Singer


   SING, Ballad-singer, raise a hearty tune;
   Make me forget that there was ever a one
   I walked with in the meek light of the moon
      When the day’s work was done.

   Rhyme, Ballad-rhymer, start a country song;
   Make me forget that she whom I loved well
   Swore she would love me dearly, love me long,
      Then—what I cannot tell!

   Sing, Ballad-singer, from your little book;
   Make me forget those heart-breaks, achings, fears;
   Make me forget her name, her sweet sweet look—
      Make me forget her tears.


II
Former Beauties


   THESE market-dames, mid-aged, with lips thin-drawn,
      And tissues sere,
   Are they the ones we loved in years agone,
      And courted here?

   Are these the muslined pink young things to whom
      We vowed and swore
   In nooks on summer Sundays by the Froom,
      Or Budmouth shore?

   Do they remember those gay tunes we trod
      Clasped on the green;
   Aye; trod till moonlight set on the beaten sod
      A satin sheen?

   They must forget, forget!  They cannot know
      What once they were,
   Or memory would transfigure them, and show
      Them always fair.


III
AFTER THE CLUB-DANCE


   BLACK’ON frowns east on Maidon,
      And westward to the sea,
   But on neither is his frown laden
      With scorn, as his frown on me!

   At dawn my heart grew heavy,
      I could not sip the wine,
   I left the jocund bevy
      And that young man o’ mine.

   The roadside elms pass by me,—
      Why do I sink with shame
   When the birds a-perch there eye me?
      They, too, have done the same!


IV
THE MARKET-GIRL


   NOBODY took any notice of her as she stood on the causey kerb,
   All eager to sell her honey and apples and bunches of garden herb;
   And if she had offered to give her wares and herself with them too
   that day,
   I doubt if a soul would have cared to take a bargain so choice away.

   But chancing to trace her sunburnt grace that morning as I passed
   nigh,
   I went and I said “Poor maidy dear!—and will none of the people buy?”
   And so it began; and soon we knew what the end of it all must be,
   And I found that though no others had bid, a prize had been won by me.


V
THE INQUIRY


   AND are ye one of Hermitage—
   Of Hermitage, by Ivel Road,
   And do ye know, in Hermitage
   A thatch-roofed house where sengreens grow?
   And does John Waywood live there still—
   He of the name that there abode
   When father hurdled on the hill
      Some fifteen years ago?

   Does he now speak o’ Patty Beech,
   The Patty Beech he used to—see,
   Or ask at all if Patty Beech
   Is known or heard of out this way?
   —Ask ever if she’s living yet,
   And where her present home may be,
   And how she bears life’s fag and fret
      After so long a day?

   In years agone at Hermitage
   This faded face was counted fair,
   None fairer; and at Hermitage
   We swore to wed when he should thrive.
   But never a chance had he or I,
   And waiting made his wish outwear,
   And Time, that dooms man’s love to die,
      Preserves a maid’s alive.


VI
A WIFE WAITS


   WILL’S at the dance in the Club-room below,
      Where the tall liquor-cups foam;
   I on the pavement up here by the Bow,
      Wait, wait, to steady him home.

   Will and his partner are treading a tune,
      Loving companions they be;
   Willy, before we were married in June,
      Said he loved no one but me;

   Said he would let his old pleasures all go
      Ever to live with his Dear.
   Will’s at the dance in the Club-room below,
      Shivering I wait for him here.

NOTE.—“The Bow” (line 3).  The old name for the curved corner by the
cross-streets in the middle of Casterbridge.


VII
AFTER THE FAIR


   THE singers are gone from the Cornmarket-place
         With their broadsheets of rhymes,
   The street rings no longer in treble and bass
         With their skits on the times,
   And the Cross, lately thronged, is a dim naked space
      That but echoes the stammering chimes.

   From Clock-corner steps, as each quarter ding-dongs,
         Away the folk roam
   By the “Hart” and Grey’s Bridge into byways and “drongs,”
         Or across the ridged loam;
   The younger ones shrilling the lately heard songs,
      The old saying, “Would we were home.”

   The shy-seeming maiden so mute in the fair
         Now rattles and talks,
   And that one who looked the most swaggering there
         Grows sad as she walks,
   And she who seemed eaten by cankering care
      In statuesque sturdiness stalks.

   And midnight clears High Street of all but the ghosts
         Of its buried burghees,
   From the latest far back to those old Roman hosts
         Whose remains one yet sees,
   Who loved, laughed, and fought, hailed their friends, drank their
   toasts
      At their meeting-times here, just as these!

1902.

NOTE.—“The Chimes” (line 6) will be listened for in vain here at midnight
now, having been abolished some years ago.



THE DARK-EYED GENTLEMAN


                                    I

   I PITCHED my day’s leazings in Crimmercrock Lane,
   To tie up my garter and jog on again,
   When a dear dark-eyed gentleman passed there and said,
   In a way that made all o’ me colour rose-red,
      “What do I see—
      O pretty knee!”
   And he came and he tied up my garter for me.

                                    II

   ’Twixt sunset and moonrise it was, I can mind:
   Ah, ’tis easy to lose what we nevermore find!—
   Of the dear stranger’s home, of his name, I knew nought,
   But I soon knew his nature and all that it brought.
      Then bitterly
      Sobbed I that he
   Should ever have tied up my garter for me!

                                   III

   Yet now I’ve beside me a fine lissom lad,
   And my slip’s nigh forgot, and my days are not sad;
   My own dearest joy is he, comrade, and friend,
   He it is who safe-guards me, on him I depend;
      No sorrow brings he,
      And thankful I be
   That his daddy once tied up my garter for me!

NOTE.—“Leazings” (line 1).—Bundle of gleaned corn.



TO CARREY CLAVEL


   YOU turn your back, you turn your back,
      And never your face to me,
   Alone you take your homeward track,
      And scorn my company.

   What will you do when Charley’s seen
      Dewbeating down this way?
   —You’ll turn your back as now, you mean?
      Nay, Carrey Clavel, nay!

   You’ll see none’s looking; put your lip
      Up like a tulip, so;
   And he will coll you, bend, and sip:
      Yes, Carrey, yes; I know!



THE ORPHANED OLD MAID


   I WANTED to marry, but father said, “No—
   ’Tis weakness in women to give themselves so;
   If you care for your freedom you’ll listen to me,
   Make a spouse in your pocket, and let the men be.”

   I spake on’t again and again: father cried,
   “Why—if you go husbanding, where shall I bide?
   For never a home’s for me elsewhere than here!”
   And I yielded; for father had ever been dear.

   But now father’s gone, and I feel growing old,
   And I’m lonely and poor in this house on the wold,
   And my sweetheart that was found a partner elsewhere,
   And nobody flings me a thought or a care.



THE SPRING CALL


   DOWN Wessex way, when spring’s a-shine,
      The blackbird’s “pret-ty de-urr!”
   In Wessex accents marked as mine
      Is heard afar and near.

   He flutes it strong, as if in song
      No R’s of feebler tone
   Than his appear in “pretty dear,”
      Have blackbirds ever known.

   Yet they pipe “prattie deerh!” I glean,
      Beneath a Scottish sky,
   And “pehty de-aw!” amid the treen
      Of Middlesex or nigh.

   While some folk say—perhaps in play—
      Who know the Irish isle,
   ’Tis “purrity dare!” in treeland there
      When songsters would beguile.

   Well: I’ll say what the listening birds
      Say, hearing “pret-ty de-urr!”—
   However strangers sound such words,
      That’s how we sound them here.

   Yes, in this clime at pairing time,
      As soon as eyes can see her
   At dawn of day, the proper way
      To call is “pret-ty de-urr!”



JULIE-JANE


      SING; how ’a would sing!
      How ’a would raise the tune
   When we rode in the waggon from harvesting
         By the light o’ the moon!

      Dance; how ’a would dance!
      If a fiddlestring did but sound
   She would hold out her coats, give a slanting glance,
         And go round and round.

      Laugh; how ’a would laugh!
      Her peony lips would part
   As if none such a place for a lover to quaff
         At the deeps of a heart.

      Julie, O girl of joy,
      Soon, soon that lover he came.
   Ah, yes; and gave thee a baby-boy,
         But never his name . . .

      —Tolling for her, as you guess;
      And the baby too . . . ’Tis well.
   You knew her in maidhood likewise?—Yes,
         That’s her burial bell.

      “I suppose,” with a laugh, she said,
      “I should blush that I’m not a wife;
   But how can it matter, so soon to be dead,
         What one does in life!”

      When we sat making the mourning
      By her death-bed side, said she,
   “Dears, how can you keep from your lovers, adorning
         In honour of me!”

      Bubbling and brightsome eyed!
      But now—O never again.
   She chose her bearers before she died
         From her fancy-men.

NOTE.—It is, or was, a common custom in Wessex, and probably other
country places, to prepare the mourning beside the death-bed, the dying
person sometimes assisting, who also selects his or her bearers on such
occasions.

“Coats” (line 7).—Old name for petticoats.



NEWS FOR HER MOTHER


                                    I

      ONE mile more is
      Where your door is
         Mother mine!—
      Harvest’s coming,
      Mills are strumming,
         Apples fine,
   And the cider made to-year will be as wine.

                                    II

      Yet, not viewing
      What’s a-doing
         Here around
      Is it thrills me,
      And so fills me
         That I bound
   Like a ball or leaf or lamb along the ground.

                                   III

      Tremble not now
      At your lot now,
         Silly soul!
      Hosts have sped them
      Quick to wed them,
         Great and small,
   Since the first two sighing half-hearts made a whole.

                                    IV

      Yet I wonder,
      Will it sunder
         Her from me?
      Will she guess that
      I said “Yes,”—that
         His I’d be,
   Ere I thought she might not see him as I see!

                                    V

      Old brown gable,
      Granary, stable,
         Here you are!
      O my mother,
      Can another
         Ever bar
   Mine from thy heart, make thy nearness seem afar?



THE FIDDLER


   THE fiddler knows what’s brewing
      To the lilt of his lyric wiles:
   The fiddler knows what rueing
      Will come of this night’s smiles!

   He sees couples join them for dancing,
      And afterwards joining for life,
   He sees them pay high for their prancing
      By a welter of wedded strife.

   He twangs: “Music hails from the devil,
      Though vaunted to come from heaven,
   For it makes people do at a revel
      What multiplies sins by seven.

   “There’s many a heart now mangled,
      And waiting its time to go,
   Whose tendrils were first entangled
      By my sweet viol and bow!”



THE HUSBAND’S VIEW


   “CAN anything avail
   Beldame, for my hid grief?—
   Listen: I’ll tell the tale,
   It may bring faint relief!—

   “I came where I was not known,
   In hope to flee my sin;
   And walking forth alone
   A young man said, ‘Good e’en.’

   “In gentle voice and true
   He asked to marry me;
   ‘You only—only you
   Fulfil my dream!’ said he.

   “We married o’ Monday morn,
   In the month of hay and flowers;
   My cares were nigh forsworn,
   And perfect love was ours.

   “But ere the days are long
   Untimely fruit will show;
   My Love keeps up his song,
   Undreaming it is so.

   “And I awake in the night,
   And think of months gone by,
   And of that cause of flight
   Hidden from my Love’s eye.

   “Discovery borders near,
   And then! . . . But something stirred?—
   My husband—he is here!
   Heaven—has he overheard?”—

   “Yes; I have heard, sweet Nan;
   I have known it all the time.
   I am not a particular man;
   Misfortunes are no crime:

   “And what with our serious need
   Of sons for soldiering,
   That accident, indeed,
   To maids, is a useful thing!”



ROSE-ANN


   WHY didn’t you say you was promised, Rose-Ann?
      Why didn’t you name it to me,
   Ere ever you tempted me hither, Rose-Ann,
      So often, so wearifully?

   O why did you let me be near ’ee, Rose-Ann,
      Talking things about wedlock so free,
   And never by nod or by whisper, Rose-Ann,
      Give a hint that it wasn’t to be?

   Down home I was raising a flock of stock ewes,
      Cocks and hens, and wee chickens by scores,
   And lavendered linen all ready to use,
      A-dreaming that they would be yours.

   Mother said: “She’s a sport-making maiden, my son”;
      And a pretty sharp quarrel had we;
   O why do you prove by this wrong you have done
      That I saw not what mother could see?

   Never once did you say you was promised, Rose-Ann,
      Never once did I dream it to be;
   And it cuts to the heart to be treated, Rose-Ann,
      As you in your scorning treat me!



THE HOMECOMING


   _GRUFFLY growled the wind on Toller downland broad and bare_,
   _And lonesome was the house_, _and dark_; _and few came there_.

   “Now don’t ye rub your eyes so red; we’re home and have no cares;
   Here’s a skimmer-cake for supper, peckled onions, and some pears;
   I’ve got a little keg o’ summat strong, too, under stairs:
   —What, slight your husband’s victuals?  Other brides can tackle
   theirs!”

   _The wind of winter mooed and mouthed their chimney like a horn_,
   _And round the house and past the house ’twas leafless and lorn_.

   “But my dear and tender poppet, then, how came ye to agree
   In Ivel church this morning?  Sure, there-right you married me!”
   —“Hoo-hoo!—I don’t know—I forgot how strange and far ’twould be,
   An’ I wish I was at home again with dear daddee!”

   _Gruffly growled the wind on Toller downland broad and bare_,
   _And lonesome was the house and dark_; _and few came there_.

   “I didn’t think such furniture as this was all you’d own,
   And great black beams for ceiling, and a floor o’ wretched stone,
   And nasty pewter platters, horrid forks of steel and bone,
   And a monstrous crock in chimney.  ’Twas to me quite unbeknown!”

   _Rattle rattle went the door_; _down flapped a cloud of smoke_,
   _As shifting north the wicked wind assayed a smarter stroke_.

   “Now sit ye by the fire, poppet; put yourself at ease:
   And keep your little thumb out of your mouth, dear, please!
   And I’ll sing to ’ee a pretty song of lovely flowers and bees,
   And happy lovers taking walks within a grove o’ trees.”

   _Gruffly growled the wind on Toller Down_, _so bleak and bare_,
   _And lonesome was the house_, _and dark_; _and few came there_.

   “Now, don’t ye gnaw your handkercher; ’twill hurt your little tongue,
   And if you do feel spitish, ’tis because ye are over young;
   But you’ll be getting older, like us all, ere very long,
   And you’ll see me as I am—a man who never did ’ee wrong.”

   _Straight from Whit’sheet Hill to Benvill Lane the blusters pass_,
   _Hitting hedges_, _milestones_, _handposts_, _trees_, _and tufts of
   grass_.

   “Well, had I only known, my dear, that this was how you’d be,
   I’d have married her of riper years that was so fond of me.
   But since I can’t, I’ve half a mind to run away to sea,
   And leave ’ee to go barefoot to your d—d daddee!”

   _Up one wall and down the other—past each window-pane—_
   _Prance the gusts_, _and then away down Crimmercrock’s long lane_.

   “I—I—don’t know what to say to’t, since your wife I’ve vowed to be;
   And as ’tis done, I s’pose here I must bide—poor me!
   Aye—as you are ki-ki-kind, I’ll try to live along with ’ee,
   Although I’d fain have stayed at home with dear daddee!”

   _Gruffly growled the wind on Toller Down_, _so bleak and bare_,
   _And lonesome was the house and dark_; _and few came there_.

   “That’s right, my Heart!  And though on haunted Toller Down we be,
   And the wind swears things in chimley, we’ll to supper merrily!
   So don’t ye tap your shoe so pettish-like; but smile at me,
   And ye’ll soon forget to sock and sigh for dear daddee!”

_December_ 1901.




PIECES OCCASIONAL AND VARIOUS


A CHURCH ROMANCE
(MELLSTOCK _circa_ 1835)


   SHE turned in the high pew, until her sight
   Swept the west gallery, and caught its row
   Of music-men with viol, book, and bow
   Against the sinking sad tower-window light.

   She turned again; and in her pride’s despite
   One strenuous viol’s inspirer seemed to throw
   A message from his string to her below,
   Which said: “I claim thee as my own forthright!”

   Thus their hearts’ bond began, in due time signed.
   And long years thence, when Age had scared Romance,
   At some old attitude of his or glance
   That gallery-scene would break upon her mind,
   With him as minstrel, ardent, young, and trim,
   Bowing “New Sabbath” or “Mount Ephraim.”



THE RASH BRIDE
AN EXPERIENCE OF THE MELLSTOCK QUIRE


                                    I

   WE Christmas-carolled down the Vale, and up the Vale, and round the
   Vale,
   We played and sang that night as we were yearly wont to do—
   A carol in a minor key, a carol in the major D,
   Then at each house: “Good wishes: many Christmas joys to you!”

                                    II

   Next, to the widow’s John and I and all the rest drew on.  And I
   Discerned that John could hardly hold the tongue of him for joy.
   The widow was a sweet young thing whom John was bent on marrying,
   And quiring at her casement seemed romantic to the boy.

                                   III

   “She’ll make reply, I trust,” said he, “to our salute?  She must!”
   said he,
   “And then I will accost her gently—much to her surprise!—
   For knowing not I am with you here, when I speak up and call her dear
   A tenderness will fill her voice, a bashfulness her eyes.

                                    IV

   So, by her window-square we stood; ay, with our lanterns there we
   stood,
   And he along with us,—not singing, waiting for a sign;
   And when we’d quired her carols three a light was lit and out looked
   she,
   A shawl about her bedgown, and her colour red as wine.

                                    V

   And sweetly then she bowed her thanks, and smiled, and spoke aloud her
   thanks;
   When lo, behind her back there, in the room, a man appeared.
   I knew him—one from Woolcomb way—Giles Swetman—honest as the day,
   But eager, hasty; and I felt that some strange trouble neared.

                                    VI

   “How comes he there? . . . Suppose,” said we, “she’s wed of late!  Who
   knows?” said we.
   —“She married yester-morning—only mother yet has known
   The secret o’t!” shrilled one small boy.  “But now I’ve told, let’s
   wish ’em joy!”
   A heavy fall aroused us: John had gone down like a stone.

                                   VII

   We rushed to him and caught him round, and lifted him, and brought him
   round,
   When, hearing something wrong had happened, oped the window she:
   “Has one of you fallen ill?” she asked, “by these night labours
   overtasked?”
   None answered.  That she’d done poor John a cruel turn felt we.

                                   VIII

   Till up spoke Michael: “Fie, young dame!  You’ve broke your promise,
   sly young dame,
   By forming this new tie, young dame, and jilting John so true,
   Who trudged to-night to sing to ’ee because he thought he’d bring to
   ’ee
   Good wishes as your coming spouse.  May ye such trifling rue!”

                                    IX

   Her man had said no word at all; but being behind had heard it all,
   And now cried: “Neighbours, on my soul I knew not ’twas like this!”
   And then to her: “If I had known you’d had in tow not me alone,
   No wife should you have been of mine.  It is a dear bought bliss!”

                                    X

   She changed death-white, and heaved a cry: we’d never heard so grieved
   a cry
   As came from her at this from him: heart-broken quite seemed she;
   And suddenly, as we looked on, she turned, and rushed; and she was
   gone,
   Whither, her husband, following after, knew not; nor knew we.

                                    XI

   We searched till dawn about the house; within the house, without the
   house,
   We searched among the laurel boughs that grew beneath the wall,
   And then among the crocks and things, and stores for winter
   junketings,
   In linhay, loft, and dairy; but we found her not at all.

                                   XII

   Then John rushed in: “O friends,” he said, “hear this, this, this!”
   and bends his head:
   “I’ve—searched round by the—_well_, and find the cover open wide!
   I am fearful that—I can’t say what . . . Bring lanterns, and some
   cords to knot.”
   We did so, and we went and stood the deep dark hole beside.

                                   XIII

   And then they, ropes in hand, and I—ay, John, and all the band, and I
   Let down a lantern to the depths—some hundred feet and more;
   It glimmered like a fog-dimmed star; and there, beside its light,
   afar,
   White drapery floated, and we knew the meaning that it bore.

                                   XIV

   The rest is naught . . . We buried her o’ Sunday.  Neighbours carried
   her;
   And Swetman—he who’d married her—now miserablest of men,
   Walked mourning first; and then walked John; just quivering, but
   composed anon;
   And we the quire formed round the grave, as was the custom then.

                                    XV

   Our old bass player, as I recall—his white hair blown—but why recall!—
   His viol upstrapped, bent figure—doomed to follow her full soon—
   Stood bowing, pale and tremulous; and next to him the rest of us . . .
   We sang the Ninetieth Psalm to her—set to Saint Stephen’s tune.



THE DEAD QUIRE


                                    I

   BESIDE the Mead of Memories,
   Where Church-way mounts to Moaning Hill,
   The sad man sighed his phantasies:
      He seems to sigh them still.

                                    II

   “’Twas the Birth-tide Eve, and the hamleteers
   Made merry with ancient Mellstock zest,
   But the Mellstock quire of former years
      Had entered into rest.

                                   III

   “Old Dewy lay by the gaunt yew tree,
   And Reuben and Michael a pace behind,
   And Bowman with his family
      By the wall that the ivies bind.

                                    IV

   “The singers had followed one by one,
   Treble, and tenor, and thorough-bass;
   And the worm that wasteth had begun
      To mine their mouldering place.

                                    V

   “For two-score years, ere Christ-day light,
   Mellstock had throbbed to strains from these;
   But now there echoed on the night
      No Christmas harmonies.

                                    VI

   “Three meadows off, at a dormered inn,
   The youth had gathered in high carouse,
   And, ranged on settles, some therein
      Had drunk them to a drowse.

                                   VII

   “Loud, lively, reckless, some had grown,
   Each dandling on his jigging knee
   Eliza, Dolly, Nance, or Joan—
      Livers in levity.

                                   VIII

   “The taper flames and hearthfire shine
   Grew smoke-hazed to a lurid light,
   And songs on subjects not divine
      Were warbled forth that night.

                                    IX

   “Yet many were sons and grandsons here
   Of those who, on such eves gone by,
   At that still hour had throated clear
      Their anthems to the sky.

                                    X

   “The clock belled midnight; and ere long
   One shouted, ‘Now ’tis Christmas morn;
   Here’s to our women old and young,
      And to John Barleycorn!’

                                    XI

   “They drink the toast and shout again:
   The pewter-ware rings back the boom,
   And for a breath-while follows then
      A silence in the room.

                                   XII

   “When nigh without, as in old days,
   The ancient quire of voice and string
   Seemed singing words of prayer and praise
      As they had used to sing:

                                   XIII

   “‘While shepherds watch’d their flocks by night,’—
   Thus swells the long familiar sound
   In many a quaint symphonic flight—
      To, ‘Glory shone around.’

                                   XIV

   “The sons defined their fathers’ tones,
   The widow his whom she had wed,
   And others in the minor moans
      The viols of the dead.

                                    XV

   “Something supernal has the sound
   As verse by verse the strain proceeds,
   And stilly staring on the ground
      Each roysterer holds and heeds.

                                   XVI

   “Towards its chorded closing bar
   Plaintively, thinly, waned the hymn,
   Yet lingered, like the notes afar
      Of banded seraphim.

                                   XVII

   “With brows abashed, and reverent tread,
   The hearkeners sought the tavern door:
   But nothing, save wan moonlight, spread
      The empty highway o’er.

                                  XVIII

   “While on their hearing fixed and tense
   The aerial music seemed to sink,
   As it were gently moving thence
      Along the river brink.

                                   XIX

   “Then did the Quick pursue the Dead
   By crystal Froom that crinkles there;
   And still the viewless quire ahead
      Voiced the old holy air.

                                    XX

   “By Bank-walk wicket, brightly bleached,
   It passed, and ’twixt the hedges twain,
   Dogged by the living; till it reached
      The bottom of Church Lane.

                                   XXI

   “There, at the turning, it was heard
   Drawing to where the churchyard lay:
   But when they followed thitherward
      It smalled, and died away.

                                   XXII

   “Each headstone of the quire, each mound,
   Confronted them beneath the moon;
   But no more floated therearound
      That ancient Birth-night tune.

                                  XXIII

   “There Dewy lay by the gaunt yew tree,
   There Reuben and Michael, a pace behind,
   And Bowman with his family
      By the wall that the ivies bind . . .

                                   XXIV

   “As from a dream each sobered son
   Awoke, and musing reached his door:
   ’Twas said that of them all, not one
      Sat in a tavern more.”

                                   XXV

   —The sad man ceased; and ceased to heed
   His listener, and crossed the leaze
   From Moaning Hill towards the mead—
      The Mead of Memories.

1897.



THE CHRISTENING


   WHOSE child is this they bring
      Into the aisle?—
   At so superb a thing
   The congregation smile
   And turn their heads awhile.

   Its eyes are blue and bright,
      Its cheeks like rose;
   Its simple robes unite
   Whitest of calicoes
   With lawn, and satin bows.

   A pride in the human race
      At this paragon
   Of mortals, lights each face
   While the old rite goes on;
   But ah, they are shocked anon.

   What girl is she who peeps
      From the gallery stair,
   Smiles palely, redly weeps,
   With feverish furtive air
   As though not fitly there?

   “I am the baby’s mother;
      This gem of the race
   The decent fain would smother,
   And for my deep disgrace
   I am bidden to leave the place.”

   “Where is the baby’s father?”—
      “In the woods afar.
   He says there is none he’d rather
   Meet under moon or star
   Than me, of all that are.

   “To clasp me in lovelike weather,
      Wish fixing when,
   He says: To be together
   At will, just now and then,
   Makes him the blest of men;

   “But chained and doomed for life
      To slovening
   As vulgar man and wife,
   He says, is another thing:
   Yea: sweet Love’s sepulchring!”

1904.



A DREAM QUESTION


    “It shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine.”

                                                             MICAH iii. 6.

   I ASKED the Lord: “Sire, is this true
   Which hosts of theologians hold,
   That when we creatures censure you
   For shaping griefs and ails untold
   (Deeming them punishments undue)
   You rage, as Moses wrote of old?

   When we exclaim: ‘Beneficent
   He is not, for he orders pain,
   Or, if so, not omnipotent:
   To a mere child the thing is plain!’
   Those who profess to represent
   You, cry out: ‘Impious and profane!’”

   He: “Save me from my friends, who deem
   That I care what my creatures say!
   Mouth as you list: sneer, rail, blaspheme,
   O manikin, the livelong day,
   Not one grief-groan or pleasure-gleam
   Will you increase or take away.

   “Why things are thus, whoso derides,
   May well remain my secret still . . .
   A fourth dimension, say the guides,
   To matter is conceivable.
   Think some such mystery resides
   Within the ethic of my will.”



BY THE BARROWS


   NOT far from Mellstock—so tradition saith—
   Where barrows, bulging as they bosoms were
   Of Multimammia stretched supinely there,
   Catch night and noon the tempest’s wanton breath,

   A battle, desperate doubtless unto death,
   Was one time fought.  The outlook, lone and bare,
   The towering hawk and passing raven share,
   And all the upland round is called “The He’th.”

   Here once a woman, in our modern age,
   Fought singlehandedly to shield a child—
   One not her own—from a man’s senseless rage.
   And to my mind no patriots’ bones there piled
   So consecrate the silence as her deed
   Of stoic and devoted self-unheed.



A WIFE AND ANOTHER


      “WAR ends, and he’s returning
         Early; yea,
      The evening next to-morrow’s!”—
         —This I say
   To her, whom I suspiciously survey,

      Holding my husband’s letter
         To her view.—
      She glanced at it but lightly,
         And I knew
   That one from him that day had reached her too.

      There was no time for scruple;
         Secretly
      I filched her missive, conned it,
         Learnt that he
   Would lodge with her ere he came home to me.

      To reach the port before her,
         And, unscanned,
      There wait to intercept them
         Soon I planned:
   That, in her stead, _I_ might before him stand.

      So purposed, so effected;
         At the inn
      Assigned, I found her hidden:—
         O that sin
   Should bear what she bore when I entered in!

      Her heavy lids grew laden
         With despairs,
      Her lips made soundless movements
         Unawares,
   While I peered at the chamber hired as theirs.

      And as beside its doorway,
         Deadly hued,
      One inside, one withoutside
         We two stood,
   He came—my husband—as she knew he would.

      No pleasurable triumph
         Was that sight!
      The ghastly disappointment
         Broke them quite.
   What love was theirs, to move them with such might!

      “Madam, forgive me!” said she,
         Sorrow bent,
      “A child—I soon shall bear him . . .
         Yes—I meant
   To tell you—that he won me ere he went.”

      Then, as it were, within me
         Something snapped,
      As if my soul had largened:
         Conscience-capped,
   I saw myself the snarer—them the trapped.

      “My hate dies, and I promise,
         Grace-beguiled,”
      I said, “to care for you, be
         Reconciled;
   And cherish, and take interest in the child.”

      Without more words I pressed him
         Through the door
      Within which she stood, powerless
         To say more,
   And closed it on them, and downstairward bore.

      “He joins his wife—my sister,”
         I, below,
      Remarked in going—lightly—
         Even as though
   All had come right, and we had arranged it so . . .

      As I, my road retracing,
         Left them free,
      The night alone embracing
         Childless me,
   I held I had not stirred God wrothfully.



THE ROMAN ROAD


   THE Roman Road runs straight and bare
   As the pale parting-line in hair
   Across the heath.  And thoughtful men
   Contrast its days of Now and Then,
   And delve, and measure, and compare;

   Visioning on the vacant air
   Helmed legionaries, who proudly rear
   The Eagle, as they pace again
      The Roman Road.

   But no tall brass-helmed legionnaire
   Haunts it for me.  Uprises there
   A mother’s form upon my ken,
   Guiding my infant steps, as when
   We walked that ancient thoroughfare,
      The Roman Road.



THE VAMPIRINE FAIR


   GILBERT had sailed to India’s shore,
      And I was all alone:
   My lord came in at my open door
      And said, “O fairest one!”

   He leant upon the slant bureau,
      And sighed, “I am sick for thee!”
   “My lord,” said I, “pray speak not so,
      Since wedded wife I be.”

   Leaning upon the slant bureau,
      Bitter his next words came:
   “So much I know; and likewise know
      My love burns on the same!

   “But since you thrust my love away,
      And since it knows no cure,
   I must live out as best I may
      The ache that I endure.”

   When Michaelmas browned the nether Coomb,
      And Wingreen Hill above,
   And made the hollyhocks rags of bloom,
      My lord grew ill of love.

   My lord grew ill with love for me;
      Gilbert was far from port;
   And—so it was—that time did see
      Me housed at Manor Court.

   About the bowers of Manor Court
      The primrose pushed its head
   When, on a day at last, report
      Arrived of him I had wed.

   “Gilbert, my lord, is homeward bound,
      His sloop is drawing near,
   What shall I do when I am found
      Not in his house but here?”

   “O I will heal the injuries
      I’ve done to him and thee.
   I’ll give him means to live at ease
      Afar from Shastonb’ry.”

   When Gilbert came we both took thought:
      “Since comfort and good cheer,”
   Said he, “So readily are bought,
      He’s welcome to thee, Dear.”

   So when my lord flung liberally
      His gold in Gilbert’s hands,
   I coaxed and got my brothers three
      Made stewards of his lands.

   And then I coaxed him to install
      My other kith and kin,
   With aim to benefit them all
      Before his love ran thin.

   And next I craved to be possessed
      Of plate and jewels rare.
   He groaned: “You give me, Love, no rest,
      Take all the law will spare!”

   And so in course of years my wealth
      Became a goodly hoard,
   My steward brethren, too, by stealth
      Had each a fortune stored.

   Thereafter in the gloom he’d walk,
      And by and by began
   To say aloud in absent talk,
      “I am a ruined man!—

   “I hardly could have thought,” he said,
      “When first I looked on thee,
   That one so soft, so rosy red,
      Could thus have beggared me!”

   Seeing his fair estates in pawn,
      And him in such decline,
   I knew that his domain had gone
      To lift up me and mine.

   Next month upon a Sunday morn
      A gunshot sounded nigh:
   By his own hand my lordly born
      Had doomed himself to die.

   “Live, my dear lord, and much of thine
      Shall be restored to thee!”
   He smiled, and said ’twixt word and sign,
      “Alas—that cannot be!”

   And while I searched his cabinet
      For letters, keys, or will,
   ’Twas touching that his gaze was set
      With love upon me still.

   And when I burnt each document
      Before his dying eyes,
   ’Twas sweet that he did not resent
      My fear of compromise.

   The steeple-cock gleamed golden when
      I watched his spirit go:
   And I became repentant then
      That I had wrecked him so.

   Three weeks at least had come and gone,
      With many a saddened word,
   Before I wrote to Gilbert on
      The stroke that so had stirred.

   And having worn a mournful gown,
      I joined, in decent while,
   My husband at a dashing town
      To live in dashing style.

   Yet though I now enjoy my fling,
      And dine and dance and drive,
   I’d give my prettiest emerald ring
      To see my lord alive.

   And when the meet on hunting-days
      Is near his churchyard home,
   I leave my bantering beaux to place
      A flower upon his tomb;

   And sometimes say: “Perhaps too late
      The saints in Heaven deplore
   That tender time when, moved by Fate,
      He darked my cottage door.”



THE REMINDER


   WHILE I watch the Christmas blaze
   Paint the room with ruddy rays,
   Something makes my vision glide
   To the frosty scene outside.

   There, to reach a rotting berry,
   Toils a thrush,—constrained to very
   Dregs of food by sharp distress,
   Taking such with thankfulness.

   Why, O starving bird, when I
   One day’s joy would justify,
   And put misery out of view,
   Do you make me notice you!



THE RAMBLER


   I DO not see the hills around,
   Nor mark the tints the copses wear;
   I do not note the grassy ground
   And constellated daisies there.

   I hear not the contralto note
   Of cuckoos hid on either hand,
   The whirr that shakes the nighthawk’s throat
   When eve’s brown awning hoods the land.

   Some say each songster, tree, and mead—
   All eloquent of love divine—
   Receives their constant careful heed:
   Such keen appraisement is not mine.

   The tones around me that I hear,
   The aspects, meanings, shapes I see,
   Are those far back ones missed when near,
   And now perceived too late by me!



NIGHT IN THE OLD HOME


   When the wasting embers redden the chimney-breast,
   And Life’s bare pathway looms like a desert track to me,
   And from hall and parlour the living have gone to their rest,
   My perished people who housed them here come back to me.

   They come and seat them around in their mouldy places,
   Now and then bending towards me a glance of wistfulness,
   A strange upbraiding smile upon all their faces,
   And in the bearing of each a passive tristfulness.

   “Do you uphold me, lingering and languishing here,
   A pale late plant of your once strong stock?” I say to them;
   “A thinker of crooked thoughts upon Life in the sere,
   And on That which consigns men to night after showing the day to
   them?”

   “—O let be the Wherefore!  We fevered our years not thus:
   Take of Life what it grants, without question!” they answer me
   seemingly.
   “Enjoy, suffer, wait: spread the table here freely like us,
   And, satisfied, placid, unfretting, watch Time away beamingly!”



AFTER THE LAST BREATH
(J. H. 1813–1904)


   THERE’S no more to be done, or feared, or hoped;
   None now need watch, speak low, and list, and tire;
   No irksome crease outsmoothed, no pillow sloped
      Does she require.

   Blankly we gaze.  We are free to go or stay;
   Our morrow’s anxious plans have missed their aim;
   Whether we leave to-night or wait till day
      Counts as the same.

   The lettered vessels of medicaments
   Seem asking wherefore we have set them here;
   Each palliative its silly face presents
      As useless gear.

   And yet we feel that something savours well;
   We note a numb relief withheld before;
   Our well-beloved is prisoner in the cell
      Of Time no more.

   We see by littles now the deft achievement
   Whereby she has escaped the Wrongers all,
   In view of which our momentary bereavement
      Outshapes but small.

1904.



IN CHILDBED


      IN the middle of the night
   Mother’s spirit came and spoke to me,
      Looking weariful and white—
   As ’twere untimely news she broke to me.

      “O my daughter, joyed are you
   To own the weetless child you mother there;
      ‘Men may search the wide world through,’
   You think, ‘nor find so fair another there!’

      “Dear, this midnight time unwombs
   Thousands just as rare and beautiful;
      Thousands whom High Heaven foredooms
   To be as bright, as good, as dutiful.

      “Source of ecstatic hopes and fears
   And innocent maternal vanity,
      Your fond exploit but shapes for tears
   New thoroughfares in sad humanity.

      “Yet as you dream, so dreamt I
   When Life stretched forth its morning ray to me;
      Other views for by and by!” . . .
   Such strange things did mother say to me.



THE PINE PLANTERS
(MARTY SOUTH’S REVERIE)


                                    I

   WE work here together
      In blast and breeze;
   He fills the earth in,
      I hold the trees.

   He does not notice
      That what I do
   Keeps me from moving
      And chills me through.

   He has seen one fairer
      I feel by his eye,
   Which skims me as though
      I were not by.

   And since she passed here
      He scarce has known
   But that the woodland
      Holds him alone.

   I have worked here with him
      Since morning shine,
   He busy with his thoughts
      And I with mine.

   I have helped him so many,
      So many days,
   But never win any
      Small word of praise!

   Shall I not sigh to him
      That I work on
   Glad to be nigh to him
      Though hope is gone?

   Nay, though he never
      Knew love like mine,
   I’ll bear it ever
      And make no sign!

                                    II

   From the bundle at hand here
      I take each tree,
   And set it to stand, here
      Always to be;
   When, in a second,
      As if from fear
   Of Life unreckoned
      Beginning here,
   It starts a sighing
      Through day and night,
   Though while there lying
      ’Twas voiceless quite.

   It will sigh in the morning,
      Will sigh at noon,
   At the winter’s warning,
      In wafts of June;
   Grieving that never
      Kind Fate decreed
   It should for ever
      Remain a seed,
   And shun the welter
      Of things without,
   Unneeding shelter
      From storm and drought.

   Thus, all unknowing
      For whom or what
   We set it growing
      In this bleak spot,
   It still will grieve here
      Throughout its time,
   Unable to leave here,
      Or change its clime;
   Or tell the story
      Of us to-day
   When, halt and hoary,
      We pass away.



THE DEAR


   I PLODDED to Fairmile Hill-top, where
      A maiden one fain would guard
   From every hazard and every care
      Advanced on the roadside sward.

   I wondered how succeeding suns
      Would shape her wayfarings,
   And wished some Power might take such ones
      Under Its warding wings.

   The busy breeze came up the hill
      And smartened her cheek to red,
   And frizzled her hair to a haze.  With a will
      “Good-morning, my Dear!” I said.

   She glanced from me to the far-off gray,
      And, with proud severity,
   “Good-morning to you—though I may say
      I am not _your_ Dear,” quoth she:

   “For I am the Dear of one not here—
      One far from his native land!”—
   And she passed me by; and I did not try
      To make her understand.

1901



ONE WE KNEW
(M. H.  1772–1857)


   SHE told how they used to form for the country dances—
      “The Triumph,” “The New-rigged Ship”—
   To the light of the guttering wax in the panelled manses,
      And in cots to the blink of a dip.

   She spoke of the wild “poussetting” and “allemanding”
      On carpet, on oak, and on sod;
   And the two long rows of ladies and gentlemen standing,
      And the figures the couples trod.

   She showed us the spot where the maypole was yearly planted,
      And where the bandsmen stood
   While breeched and kerchiefed partners whirled, and panted
      To choose each other for good.

   She told of that far-back day when they learnt astounded
      Of the death of the King of France:
   Of the Terror; and then of Bonaparte’s unbounded
      Ambition and arrogance.

   Of how his threats woke warlike preparations
      Along the southern strand,
   And how each night brought tremors and trepidations
      Lest morning should see him land.

   She said she had often heard the gibbet creaking
      As it swayed in the lightning flash,
   Had caught from the neighbouring town a small child’s shrieking
      At the cart-tail under the lash . . .

   With cap-framed face and long gaze into the embers—
      We seated around her knees—
   She would dwell on such dead themes, not as one who remembers,
      But rather as one who sees.

   She seemed one left behind of a band gone distant
      So far that no tongue could hail:
   Past things retold were to her as things existent,
      Things present but as a tale.

_May_ 20, 1902.



SHE HEARS THE STORM


   THERE was a time in former years—
      While my roof-tree was his—
   When I should have been distressed by fears
      At such a night as this!

   I should have murmured anxiously,
      “The pricking rain strikes cold;
   His road is bare of hedge or tree,
      And he is getting old.”

   But now the fitful chimney-roar,
      The drone of Thorncombe trees,
   The Froom in flood upon the moor,
      The mud of Mellstock Leaze,

   The candle slanting sooty wick’d,
      The thuds upon the thatch,
   The eaves-drops on the window flicked,
      The clacking garden-hatch,

   And what they mean to wayfarers,
      I scarcely heed or mind;
   He has won that storm-tight roof of hers
      Which Earth grants all her kind.



A WET NIGHT


   I PACE along, the rain-shafts riddling me,
   Mile after mile out by the moorland way,
   And up the hill, and through the ewe-leaze gray
   Into the lane, and round the corner tree;

   Where, as my clothing clams me, mire-bestarred,
   And the enfeebled light dies out of day,
   Leaving the liquid shades to reign, I say,
   “This is a hardship to be calendared!”

   Yet sires of mine now perished and forgot,
   When worse beset, ere roads were shapen here,
   And night and storm were foes indeed to fear,
   Times numberless have trudged across this spot
   In sturdy muteness on their strenuous lot,
   And taking all such toils as trifles mere.



BEFORE LIFE AND AFTER


      A TIME there was—as one may guess
   And as, indeed, earth’s testimonies tell—
      Before the birth of consciousness,
         When all went well.

      None suffered sickness, love, or loss,
   None knew regret, starved hope, or heart-burnings;
      None cared whatever crash or cross
         Brought wrack to things.

      If something ceased, no tongue bewailed,
   If something winced and waned, no heart was wrung;
      If brightness dimmed, and dark prevailed,
         No sense was stung.

      But the disease of feeling germed,
   And primal rightness took the tinct of wrong;
      Ere nescience shall be reaffirmed
         How long, how long?



NEW YEAR’S EVE


   “I HAVE finished another year,” said God,
      “In grey, green, white, and brown;
   I have strewn the leaf upon the sod,
   Sealed up the worm within the clod,
      And let the last sun down.”

   “And what’s the good of it?” I said.
      “What reasons made you call
   From formless void this earth we tread,
   When nine-and-ninety can be read
      Why nought should be at all?

   “Yea, Sire; why shaped you us, ‘who in
      This tabernacle groan’—
   If ever a joy be found herein,
   Such joy no man had wished to win
      If he had never known!”

   Then he: “My labours—logicless—
      You may explain; not I:
   Sense-sealed I have wrought, without a guess
   That I evolved a Consciousness
      To ask for reasons why.

   “Strange that ephemeral creatures who
      By my own ordering are,
   Should see the shortness of my view,
   Use ethic tests I never knew,
      Or made provision for!”

   He sank to raptness as of yore,
      And opening New Year’s Day
   Wove it by rote as theretofore,
   And went on working evermore
      In his unweeting way.

1906.



GOD’S EDUCATION


   I SAW him steal the light away
      That haunted in her eye:
   It went so gently none could say
   More than that it was there one day
      And missing by-and-by.

   I watched her longer, and he stole
      Her lily tincts and rose;
   All her young sprightliness of soul
   Next fell beneath his cold control,
      And disappeared like those.

   I asked: “Why do you serve her so?
      Do you, for some glad day,
   Hoard these her sweets—?”  He said, “O no,
   They charm not me; I bid Time throw
      Them carelessly away.”

   Said I: “We call that cruelty—
      We, your poor mortal kind.”
   He mused.  “The thought is new to me.
   Forsooth, though I men’s master be,
      Theirs is the teaching mind!”



TO SINCERITY


   O SWEET sincerity!—
   Where modern methods be
   What scope for thine and thee?

   Life may be sad past saying,
   Its greens for ever graying,
   Its faiths to dust decaying;

   And youth may have foreknown it,
   And riper seasons shown it,
   But custom cries: “Disown it:

   “Say ye rejoice, though grieving,
   Believe, while unbelieving,
   Behold, without perceiving!”

   —Yet, would men look at true things,
   And unilluded view things,
   And count to bear undue things,

   The real might mend the seeming,
   Facts better their foredeeming,
   And Life its disesteeming.

_February_ 1899.



PANTHERA


(For other forms of this legend—first met with in the second century—see
Origen contra Celsum; the Talmud; Sepher Toldoth Jeschu; quoted fragments
of lost Apocryphal gospels; Strauss, Haeckel; etc.)

   YEA, as I sit here, crutched, and cricked, and bent,
   I think of Panthera, who underwent
   Much from insidious aches in his decline;
   But his aches were not radical like mine;
   They were the twinges of old wounds—the feel
   Of the hand he had lost, shorn by barbarian steel,
   Which came back, so he said, at a change in the air,
   Fingers and all, as if it still were there.
   My pains are otherwise: upclosing cramps
   And stiffened tendons from this country’s damps,
   Where Panthera was never commandant.—
   The Fates sent him by way of the Levant.
      He had been blithe in his young manhood’s time,
   And as centurion carried well his prime.
   In Ethiop, Araby, climes fair and fell,
   He had seen service and had borne him well.
   Nought shook him then: he was serene as brave;
   Yet later knew some shocks, and would grow grave
   When pondering them; shocks less of corporal kind
   Than phantom-like, that disarranged his mind;
   And it was in the way of warning me
   (By much his junior) against levity
   That he recounted them; and one in chief
   Panthera loved to set in bold relief.

      This was a tragedy of his Eastern days,
   Personal in touch—though I have sometimes thought
   That touch a possible delusion—wrought
   Of half-conviction carried to a craze—
   His mind at last being stressed by ails and age:—
   Yet his good faith thereon I well could wage.

      I had said it long had been a wish with me
   That I might leave a scion—some small tree
   As channel for my sap, if not my name—
   Ay, offspring even of no legitimate claim,
   In whose advance I secretly could joy.
   Thereat he warned.
         “Cancel such wishes, boy!
   A son may be a comfort or a curse,
   A seer, a doer, a coward, a fool; yea, worse—
   A criminal . . . That I could testify!”
   “Panthera has no guilty son!” cried I
   All unbelieving.  “Friend, you do not know,”
   He darkly dropt: “True, I’ve none now to show,
   For _the law took him_.  Ay, in sooth, Jove shaped it so!”

      “This noon is not unlike,” he again began,
   “The noon these pricking memories print on me—
   Yea, that day, when the sun grew copper-red,
   And I served in Judæa . . . ’Twas a date
   Of rest for arms.  The _Pax Romana_ ruled,
   To the chagrin of frontier legionaries!
   Palestine was annexed—though sullen yet,—
   I, being in age some two-score years and ten
   And having the garrison in Jerusalem
   Part in my hands as acting officer
   Under the Governor.  A tedious time
   I found it, of routine, amid a folk
   Restless, contentless, and irascible.—
   Quelling some riot, sentrying court and hall,
   Sending men forth on public meeting-days
   To maintain order, were my duties there.

      “Then came a morn in spring, and the cheerful sun
   Whitened the city and the hills around,
   And every mountain-road that clambered them,
   Tincturing the greyness of the olives warm,
   And the rank cacti round the valley’s sides.
   The day was one whereon death-penalties
   Were put in force, and here and there were set
   The soldiery for order, as I said,
   Since one of the condemned had raised some heat,
   And crowds surged passionately to see him slain.
   I, mounted on a Cappadocian horse,
   With some half-company of auxiliaries,
   Had captained the procession through the streets
   When it came streaming from the judgment-hall
   After the verdicts of the Governor.
   It drew to the great gate of the northern way
   That bears towards Damascus; and to a knoll
   Upon the common, just beyond the walls—
   Whence could be swept a wide horizon round
   Over the housetops to the remotest heights.
   Here was the public execution-ground
   For city crimes, called then and doubtless now
   Golgotha, Kranion, or Calvaria.

      “The usual dooms were duly meted out;
   Some three or four were stript, transfixed, and nailed,
   And no great stir occurred.  A day of wont
   It was to me, so far, and would have slid
   Clean from my memory at its squalid close
   But for an incident that followed these.

      “Among the tag-rag rabble of either sex
   That hung around the wretches as they writhed,
   Till thrust back by our spears, one held my eye—
   A weeping woman, whose strained countenance,
   Sharpened against a looming livid cloud,
   Was mocked by the crude rays of afternoon—
   The mother of one of those who suffered there
   I had heard her called when spoken roughly to
   By my ranged men for pressing forward so.
   It stole upon me hers was a face I knew;
   Yet when, or how, I had known it, for a while
   Eluded me.  And then at once it came.

      “Some thirty years or more before that noon
   I was sub-captain of a company
   Drawn from the legion of Calabria,
   That marched up from Judæa north to Tyre.
   We had pierced the old flat country of Jezreel,
   The great Esdraelon Plain and fighting-floor
   Of Jew with Canaanite, and with the host
   Of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, met
   While crossing there to strike the Assyrian pride.
   We left behind Gilboa; passed by Nain;
   Till bulging Tabor rose, embossed to the top
   With arbute, terabinth, and locust growths.

      “Encumbering me were sundry sick, so fallen
   Through drinking from a swamp beside the way;
   But we pressed on, till, bearing over a ridge,
   We dipt into a world of pleasantness—
   A vale, the fairest I had gazed upon—
   Which lapped a village on its furthest slopes
   Called Nazareth, brimmed round by uplands nigh.
   In the midst thereof a fountain bubbled, where,
   Lime-dry from marching, our glad halt we made
   To rest our sick ones, and refresh us all.

      “Here a day onward, towards the eventide,
   Our men were piping to a Pyrrhic dance
   Trod by their comrades, when the young women came
   To fill their pitchers, as their custom was.
   I proffered help to one—a slim girl, coy
   Even as a fawn, meek, and as innocent.
   Her long blue gown, the string of silver coins
   That hung down by her banded beautiful hair,
   Symboled in full immaculate modesty.

      “Well, I was young, and hot, and readily stirred
   To quick desire.  ’Twas tedious timing out
   The convalescence of the soldiery;
   And I beguiled the long and empty days
   By blissful yieldance to her sweet allure,
   Who had no arts, but what out-arted all,
   The tremulous tender charm of trustfulness.
   We met, and met, and under the winking stars
   That passed which peoples earth—true union, yea,
   To the pure eye of her simplicity.

      “Meanwhile the sick found health; and we pricked on.
   I made her no rash promise of return,
   As some do use; I was sincere in that;
   I said we sundered never to meet again—
   And yet I spoke untruth unknowingly!—
   For meet again we did.  Now, guess you aught?
   The weeping mother on Calvaria
   Was she I had known—albeit that time and tears
   Had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form,
   And her soft eyes, now swollen with sorrowing.

      “Though I betrayed some qualms, she marked me not;
   And I was scarce of mood to comrade her
   And close the silence of so wide a time
   To claim a malefactor as my son—
   (For so I guessed him).  And inquiry made
   Brought rumour how at Nazareth long before
   An old man wedded her for pity’s sake
   On finding she had grown pregnant, none knew how,
   Cared for her child, and loved her till he died.

      “Well; there it ended; save that then I learnt
   That he—the man whose ardent blood was mine—
   Had waked sedition long among the Jews,
   And hurled insulting parlance at their god,
   Whose temple bulked upon the adjoining hill,
   Vowing that he would raze it, that himself
   Was god as great as he whom they adored,
   And by descent, moreover, was their king;
   With sundry other incitements to misrule.

      “The impalements done, and done the soldiers’ game
   Of raffling for the clothes, a legionary,
   Longinus, pierced the young man with his lance
   At signs from me, moved by his agonies
   Through naysaying the drug they had offered him.
   It brought the end.  And when he had breathed his last
   The woman went.  I saw her never again . . .
   Now glares my moody meaning on you, friend?—
   That when you talk of offspring as sheer joy
   So trustingly, you blink contingencies.
   Fors Fortuna!  He who goes fathering
   Gives frightful hostages to hazardry!”

      Thus Panthera’s tale.  ’Twas one he seldom told,
   But yet it got abroad.  He would unfold,
   At other times, a story of less gloom,
   Though his was not a heart where jests had room.
   He would regret discovery of the truth
   Was made too late to influence to ruth
   The Procurator who had condemned his son—
   Or rather him so deemed.  For there was none
   To prove that Panthera erred not: and indeed,
   When vagueness of identity I would plead,
   Panther himself would sometimes own as much—
   Yet lothly.  But, assuming fact was such,
   That the said woman did not recognize
   Her lover’s face, is matter for surprise.
   However, there’s his tale, fantasy or otherwise.

      Thereafter shone not men of Panthera’s kind:
   The indolent heads at home were ill-inclined
   To press campaigning that would hoist the star
   Of their lieutenants valorous afar.
   Jealousies kept him irked abroad, controlled
   And stinted by an Empire no more bold.
   Yet in some actions southward he had share—
   In Mauretania and Numidia; there
   With eagle eye, and sword and steed and spur,
   Quelling uprisings promptly.  Some small stir
   In Parthia next engaged him, until maimed,
   As I have said; and cynic Time proclaimed
   His noble spirit broken.  What a waste
   Of such a Roman!—one in youth-time graced
   With indescribable charm, so I have heard,
   Yea, magnetism impossible to word
   When faltering as I saw him.  What a fame,
   O Son of Saturn, had adorned his name,
   Might the Three so have urged Thee!—Hour by hour
   His own disorders hampered Panthera’s power
   To brood upon the fate of those he had known,
   Even of that one he always called his own—
   Either in morbid dream or memory . . .
   He died at no great age, untroublously,
   An exit rare for ardent soldiers such as he.



THE UNBORN


   I ROSE at night, and visited
      The Cave of the Unborn:
   And crowding shapes surrounded me
   For tidings of the life to be,
   Who long had prayed the silent Head
      To haste its advent morn.

   Their eyes were lit with artless trust,
      Hope thrilled their every tone;
   “A scene the loveliest, is it not?
   A pure delight, a beauty-spot
   Where all is gentle, true and just,
      And darkness is unknown?”

   My heart was anguished for their sake,
      I could not frame a word;
   And they descried my sunken face,
   And seemed to read therein, and trace
   The news that pity would not break,
      Nor truth leave unaverred.

   And as I silently retired
      I turned and watched them still,
   And they came helter-skelter out,
   Driven forward like a rabble rout
   Into the world they had so desired
      By the all-immanent Will.

1905.



THE MAN HE KILLED


      “HAD he and I but met
      By some old ancient inn,
   We should have sat us down to wet
      Right many a nipperkin!

      “But ranged as infantry,
      And staring face to face,
   I shot at him as he at me,
      And killed him in his place.

      “I shot him dead because—
      Because he was my foe,
   Just so: my foe of course he was;
      That’s clear enough; although

      “He thought he’d ’list, perhaps,
      Off-hand like—just as I—
   Was out of work—had sold his traps—
      No other reason why.

      “Yes; quaint and curious war is!
      You shoot a fellow down
   You’d treat if met where any bar is,
      Or help to half-a-crown.”

GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE
(A MEMORY OF CHRISTIANA C—)


   WHERE Blackmoor was, the road that led
      To Bath, she could not show,
   Nor point the sky that overspread
      Towns ten miles off or so.

   But that Calcutta stood this way,
      Cape Horn there figured fell,
   That here was Boston, here Bombay,
      She could declare full well.

   Less known to her the track athwart
      Froom Mead or Yell’ham Wood
   Than how to make some Austral port
      In seas of surly mood.

   She saw the glint of Guinea’s shore
      Behind the plum-tree nigh,
   Heard old unruly Biscay’s roar
      In the weir’s purl hard by . . .

   “My son’s a sailor, and he knows
      All seas and many lands,
   And when he’s home he points and shows
      Each country where it stands.

   “He’s now just there—by Gib’s high rock—
      And when he gets, you see,
   To Portsmouth here, behind the clock,
      Then he’ll come back to me!”



ONE RALPH BLOSSOM SOLILOQUIZES


(“It being deposed that vij women who were mayds before he knew them have
been brought upon the towne [rates?] by the fornicacions of one Ralph
Blossom, Mr Major inquired why he should not contribute xiv pence weekly
toward their mayntenance.  But it being shewn that the sayd R. B. was
dying of a purple feaver, no order was made.”—_Budmouth Borough Minutes_:
16–.)

   WHEN I am in hell or some such place,
   A-groaning over my sorry case,
   What will those seven women say to me
   Who, when I coaxed them, answered “Aye” to me?

   “I did not understand your sign!”
   Will be the words of Caroline;
   While Jane will cry, “If I’d had proof of you,
   I should have learnt to hold aloof of you!”

   “I won’t reproach: it was to be!”
   Will dryly murmur Cicely;
   And Rosa: “I feel no hostility,
   For I must own I lent facility.”

   Lizzy says: “Sharp was my regret,
   And sometimes it is now!  But yet
   I joy that, though it brought notoriousness,
   I knew Love once and all its gloriousness!”

   Says Patience: “Why are we apart?
   Small harm did you, my poor Sweet Heart!
   A manchild born, now tall and beautiful,
   Was worth the ache of days undutiful.”

   And Anne cries: “O the time was fair,
   So wherefore should you burn down there?
   There is a deed under the sun, my Love,
   And that was ours.  What’s done is done, my Love.
   These trumpets here in Heaven are dumb to me
   With you away.  Dear, come, O come to me!”



THE NOBLE LADY’S TALE
(_circa_ 1790)


                                    I

      “WE moved with pensive paces,
         I and he,
      And bent our faded faces
         Wistfully,
   For something troubled him, and troubled me.

      “The lanthorn feebly lightened
         Our grey hall,
      Where ancient brands had brightened
         Hearth and wall,
   And shapes long vanished whither vanish all.

      “‘O why, Love, nightly, daily,’
         I had said,
      ‘Dost sigh, and smile so palely,
         As if shed
   Were all Life’s blossoms, all its dear things dead?’

      “‘Since silence sets thee grieving,’
         He replied,
      ‘And I abhor deceiving
         One so tried,
   Why, Love, I’ll speak, ere time us twain divide.’

      “He held me, I remember,
         Just as when
      Our life was June—(September
         It was then);
   And we walked on, until he spoke again.

      “‘Susie, an Irish mummer,
         Loud-acclaimed
      Through the gay London summer,
         Was I; named
   A master in my art, who would be famed.

      “‘But lo, there beamed before me
         Lady Su;
      God’s altar-vow she swore me
         When none knew,
   And for her sake I bade the sock adieu.

      “‘My Lord your father’s pardon
         Thus I won:
      He let his heart unharden
         Towards his son,
   And honourably condoned what we had done;

      “‘But said—recall you, dearest?—
         _As for Su_,
      _I’d see her—ay_, _though nearest_
         _Me unto_—
   _Sooner entombed than in a stage purlieu_!

      “‘Just so.—And here he housed us,
         In this nook,
      Where Love like balm has drowsed us:
         Robin, rook,
   Our chief familiars, next to string and book.

      “‘Our days here, peace-enshrouded,
         Followed strange
      The old stage-joyance, crowded,
         Rich in range;
   But never did my soul desire a change,

      “‘Till now, when far uncertain
         Lips of yore
      Call, call me to the curtain,
         There once more,
   But _once_, to tread the boards I trod before.

      “‘A night—the last and single
         Ere I die—
      To face the lights, to mingle
         As did I
   Once in the game, and rivet every eye!’

      “Such was his wish.  He feared it,
         Feared it though
      Rare memories endeared it.
         I, also,
   Feared it still more; its outcome who could know?

      “‘Alas, my Love,’ said I then,
         ‘Since it be
      A wish so mastering, why, then,
         E’en go ye!—
   Despite your pledge to father and to me . . . ’

      “’Twas fixed; no more was spoken
         Thereupon;
      Our silences were broken
         Only on
   The petty items of his needs were gone.

      “Farewell he bade me, pleading
         That it meant
      So little, thus conceding
         To his bent;
   And then, as one constrained to go, he went.

      “Thwart thoughts I let deride me,
         As, ’twere vain
      To hope him back beside me
         Ever again:
   Could one plunge make a waxing passion wane?

      “I thought, ‘Some wild stage-woman,
         Honour-wrecked . . . ’
      But no: it was inhuman
         To suspect;
   Though little cheer could my lone heart affect!

                                    II

      “Yet came it, to my gladness,
         That, as vowed,
      He did return.—But sadness
         Swiftly cowed
   The job with which my greeting was endowed.

      “Some woe was there.  Estrangement
         Marked his mind.
      Each welcome-warm arrangement
         I had designed
   Touched him no more than deeds of careless kind.

      “‘I—_failed_!’ escaped him glumly.
         ‘—I went on
      In my old part.  But dumbly—
         Memory gone—
   Advancing, I sank sick; my vision drawn

      “‘To something drear, distressing
         As the knell
      Of all hopes worth possessing!’ . . .
         —What befell
   Seemed linked with me, but how I could not tell.

      “Hours passed; till I implored him,
         As he knew
      How faith and frankness toward him
         Ruled me through,
   To say what ill I had done, and could undo.

      “‘_Faith—frankness_.  Ah!  Heaven save such!’
         Murmured he,
      ‘They are wedded wealth!  _I_ gave such
         Liberally,
   But you, Dear, not.  For you suspected me.’

      “I was about beseeching
         In hurt haste
      More meaning, when he, reaching
         To my waist,
   Led me to pace the hall as once we paced.

      “‘I never meant to draw you
         To own all,’
      Declared he.  ‘But—I _saw_ you—
         By the wall,
   Half-hid.  And that was why I failed withal!’

      “‘Where? when?’ said I—‘Why, nigh me,
         At the play
      That night.  That you should spy me,
         Doubt my fay,
   And follow, furtive, took my heart away!’

      “That I had never been there,
         But had gone
      To my locked room—unseen there,
         Curtains drawn,
   Long days abiding—told I, wonder-wan.

      “‘Nay, ’twas your form and vesture,
         Cloak and gown,
      Your hooded features—gesture
         Half in frown,
   That faced me, pale,’ he urged, ‘that night in town.

      “‘And when, outside, I handed
         To her chair
      (As courtesy demanded
         Of me there)
   The leading lady, you peeped from the stair.

      “Straight pleaded I: ‘Forsooth, Love,
         Had I gone,
      I must have been in truth, Love,
         Mad to don
   Such well-known raiment.’  But he still went on

      “That he was not mistaken
         Nor misled.—
      I felt like one forsaken,
         Wished me dead,
   That he could think thus of the wife he had wed!

      “His going seemed to waste him
         Like a curse,
      To wreck what once had graced him;
         And, averse
   To my approach, he mused, and moped, and worse.

      “Till, what no words effected
         Thought achieved:
      _It was my wraith_—projected,
         He conceived,
   Thither, by my tense brain at home aggrieved.

      “Thereon his credence centred
         Till he died;
      And, no more tempted, entered
         Sanctified,
   The little vault with room for one beside.”

                                   III

      Thus far the lady’s story.—
         Now she, too,
      Reclines within that hoary
         Last dark mew
   In Mellstock Quire with him she loved so true.

      A yellowing marble, placed there
         Tablet-wise,
      And two joined hearts enchased there
         Meet the eyes;
   And reading their twin names we moralize:

      Did she, we wonder, follow
         Jealously?
      And were those protests hollow?—
         Or saw he
   Some semblant dame?  Or can wraiths really be?

      Were it she went, her honour,
         All may hold,
      Pressed truth at last upon her
         Till she told—
   (Him only—others as these lines unfold.)

      Riddle death-sealed for ever,
         Let it rest! . . .
      One’s heart could blame her never
         If one guessed
   That go she did.  She knew her actor best.



UNREALIZED


   DOWN comes the winter rain—
      Spoils my hat and bow—
   Runs into the poll of me;
      But mother won’t know.

   We’ve been out and caught a cold,
      Knee-deep in snow;
   Such a lucky thing it is
      That mother won’t know!

   Rosy lost herself last night—
      Couldn’t tell where to go.
   Yes—it rather frightened her,
      But mother didn’t know.

   Somebody made Willy drunk
      At the Christmas show:
   O ’twas fun!  It’s well for him
      That mother won’t know!

   Howsoever wild we are,
      Late at school or slow,
   Mother won’t be cross with us,
      Mother won’t know.

   How we cried the day she died!
      Neighbours whispering low . . .
   But we now do what we will—
      Mother won’t know.



WAGTAIL AND BABY


   A BABY watched a ford, whereto
      A wagtail came for drinking;
   A blaring bull went wading through,
      The wagtail showed no shrinking.

   A stallion splashed his way across,
      The birdie nearly sinking;
   He gave his plumes a twitch and toss,
      And held his own unblinking.

   Next saw the baby round the spot
      A mongrel slowly slinking;
   The wagtail gazed, but faltered not
      In dip and sip and prinking.

   A perfect gentleman then neared;
      The wagtail, in a winking,
   With terror rose and disappeared;
      The baby fell a-thinking.



ABERDEEN
(April: 1905)


    “And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy
    times.”—Isaiah xxxiii. 6.

   I LOOKED and thought, “All is too gray and cold
   To wake my place-enthusiasms of old!”
   Till a voice passed: “Behind that granite mien
   Lurks the imposing beauty of a Queen.”
   I looked anew; and saw the radiant form
   Of Her who soothes in stress, who steers in storm,
   On the grave influence of whose eyes sublime
   Men count for the stability of the time.



GEORGE MEREDITH
1828–1909


   FORTY years back, when much had place
   That since has perished out of mind,
   I heard that voice and saw that face.

   He spoke as one afoot will wind
   A morning horn ere men awake;
   His note was trenchant, turning kind.

   He was of those whose wit can shake
   And riddle to the very core
   The counterfeits that Time will break . . .

   Of late, when we two met once more,
   The luminous countenance and rare
   Shone just as forty years before.

   So that, when now all tongues declare
   His shape unseen by his green hill,
   I scarce believe he sits not there.

   No matter.  Further and further still
   Through the world’s vaporous vitiate air
   His words wing on—as live words will.

_May_ 1909.



YELL’HAM-WOOD’S STORY


   COOMB-FIRTREES say that Life is a moan,
      And Clyffe-hill Clump says “Yea!”
   But Yell’ham says a thing of its own:
         It’s not “Gray, gray
         Is Life alway!”
         That Yell’ham says,
      Nor that Life is for ends unknown.

   It says that Life would signify
      A thwarted purposing:
   That we come to live, and are called to die,
         Yes, that’s the thing
         In fall, in spring,
         That Yell’ham says:—
      “Life offers—to deny!”

A YOUNG MAN’S EPIGRAM ON EXISTENCE


   A senseless school, where we must give
   Our lives that we may learn to live!
   A dolt is he who memorizes
   Lessons that leave no time for prizes.

16 W. P. V., 1866.
THE TEMPORARY THE ALL


   CHANGE and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime,
   Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen;
   Wrought us fellow-like, and despite divergence,
      Friends interlinked us.

   “Cherish him can I while the true one forthcome—
   Come the rich fulfiller of my prevision;
   Life is roomy yet, and the odds unbounded.”
      So self-communed I.

   Thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter,
   Fair, the while unformed to be all-eclipsing;
   “Maiden meet,” held I, “till arise my forefelt
      Wonder of women.”

   Long a visioned hermitage deep desiring,
   Tenements uncouth I was fain to house in;
   “Let such lodging be for a breath-while,” thought I,
      “Soon a more seemly.

   “Then, high handiwork will I make my life-deed,
   Truth and Light outshow; but the ripe time pending,
   Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth.”
      Thus I . . . But lo, me!

   Mistress, friend, place, aims to be bettered straightway,
   Bettered not has Fate or my hand’s achieving;
   Sole the showance those of my onward earth-track—
      Never transcended!




AMABEL


   I MARKED her ruined hues,
   Her custom-straitened views,
   And asked, “Can there indwell
      My Amabel?”

   I looked upon her gown,
   Once rose, now earthen brown;
   The change was like the knell
      Of Amabel.

   Her step’s mechanic ways
   Had lost the life of May’s;
   Her laugh, once sweet in swell,
      Spoilt Amabel.

   I mused: “Who sings the strain
   I sang ere warmth did wane?
   Who thinks its numbers spell
      His Amabel?”—

   Knowing that, though Love cease,
   Love’s race shows undecrease;
   All find in dorp or dell
      An Amabel.

   —I felt that I could creep
   To some housetop, and weep,
   That Time the tyrant fell
      Ruled Amabel!

   I said (the while I sighed
   That love like ours had died),
   “Fond things I’ll no more tell
      To Amabel,

   “But leave her to her fate,
   And fling across the gate,
   ‘Till the Last Trump, farewell,
      O Amabel!’”

1865.





HAP


   IF but some vengeful god would call to me
   From up the sky, and laugh: “Thou suffering thing,
   Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,
   That thy love’s loss is my hate’s profiting!”

   Then would I bear, and clench myself, and die,
   Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;
   Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
   Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.

   But not so.  How arrives it joy lies slain,
   And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?
   —Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,
   And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan . . .
   These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown
   Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.

1866.




“IN VISION I ROAMED”
TO —


   IN vision I roamed the flashing Firmament,
   So fierce in blazon that the Night waxed wan,
   As though with an awed sense of such ostent;
   And as I thought my spirit ranged on and on

   In footless traverse through ghast heights of sky,
   To the last chambers of the monstrous Dome,
   Where stars the brightest here to darkness die:
   Then, any spot on our own Earth seemed Home!

   And the sick grief that you were far away
   Grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near?
   Who might have been, set on some outstep sphere,
   Less than a Want to me, as day by day
   I lived unware, uncaring all that lay
   Locked in that Universe taciturn and drear.

1866.




AT A BRIDAL
TO —


   WHEN you paced forth, to wait maternity,
   A dream of other offspring held my mind,
   Compounded of us twain as Love designed;
   Rare forms, that corporate now will never be!

   Should I, too, wed as slave to Mode’s decree,
   And each thus found apart, of false desire,
   A stolid line, whom no high aims will fire
   As had fired ours could ever have mingled we;

   And, grieved that lives so matched should mis-compose,
   Each mourn the double waste; and question dare
   To the Great Dame whence incarnation flows.
   Why those high-purposed children never were:
   What will she answer?  That she does not care
   If the race all such sovereign types unknows.

1866.




POSTPONEMENT


   SNOW-BOUND in woodland, a mournful word,
   Dropt now and then from the bill of a bird,
   Reached me on wind-wafts; and thus I heard,
      Wearily waiting:—

   “I planned her a nest in a leafless tree,
   But the passers eyed and twitted me,
   And said: ‘How reckless a bird is he,
      Cheerily mating!’

   “Fear-filled, I stayed me till summer-tide,
   In lewth of leaves to throne her bride;
   But alas! her love for me waned and died,
      Wearily waiting.

   “Ah, had I been like some I see,
   Born to an evergreen nesting-tree,
   None had eyed and twitted me,
      Cheerily mating!”

1866.




A CONFESSION TO A FRIEND IN TROUBLE


   YOUR troubles shrink not, though I feel them less
   Here, far away, than when I tarried near;
   I even smile old smiles—with listlessness—
   Yet smiles they are, not ghastly mockeries mere.

   A thought too strange to house within my brain
   Haunting its outer precincts I discern:
   —_That I will not show zeal again to learn_
   _Your griefs_, _and sharing them_, _renew my pain_ . . .

   It goes, like murky bird or buccaneer
   That shapes its lawless figure on the main,
   And each new impulse tends to make outflee
   The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here;
   Yet, comrade old, can bitterer knowledge be
   Than that, though banned, such instinct was in me!

1866.




NEUTRAL TONES


   WE stood by a pond that winter day,
   And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,
   And a few leaves lay on the starving sod,
      —They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.

   Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
   Over tedious riddles solved years ago;
   And some words played between us to and fro—
      On which lost the more by our love.

   The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
   Alive enough to have strength to die;
   And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
      Like an ominous bird a-wing . . .

   Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,
   And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me
   Your face, and the God-curst sun, and a tree,
      And a pond edged with grayish leaves.

1867.





SHE
AT HIS FUNERAL


   THEY bear him to his resting-place—
   In slow procession sweeping by;
   I follow at a stranger’s space;
   His kindred they, his sweetheart I.
   Unchanged my gown of garish dye,
   Though sable-sad is their attire;
   But they stand round with griefless eye,
   Whilst my regret consumes like fire!

187–.





HER INITIALS


   UPON a poet’s page I wrote
   Of old two letters of her name;
   Part seemed she of the effulgent thought
   Whence that high singer’s rapture came.
   —When now I turn the leaf the same
   Immortal light illumes the lay,
   But from the letters of her name
   The radiance has died away!

1869.




HER DILEMMA
(IN — CHURCH)


   THE two were silent in a sunless church,
   Whose mildewed walls, uneven paving-stones,
   And wasted carvings passed antique research;
   And nothing broke the clock’s dull monotones.

   Leaning against a wormy poppy-head,
   So wan and worn that he could scarcely stand,
   —For he was soon to die,—he softly said,
   “Tell me you love me!”—holding hard her hand.

   She would have given a world to breathe “yes” truly,
   So much his life seemed handing on her mind,
   And hence she lied, her heart persuaded throughly
   ’Twas worth her soul to be a moment kind.

   But the sad need thereof, his nearing death,
   So mocked humanity that she shamed to prize
   A world conditioned thus, or care for breath
   Where Nature such dilemmas could devise.

1866.





REVULSION


   THOUGH I waste watches framing words to fetter
   Some spirit to mine own in clasp and kiss,
   Out of the night there looms a sense ’twere better
   To fail obtaining whom one fails to miss.

   For winning love we win the risk of losing,
   And losing love is as one’s life were riven;
   It cuts like contumely and keen ill-using
   To cede what was superfluously given.

   Let me then feel no more the fateful thrilling
   That devastates the love-worn wooer’s frame,
   The hot ado of fevered hopes, the chilling
   That agonizes disappointed aim!
   So may I live no junctive law fulfilling,
   And my heart’s table bear no woman’s name.

1866.





SHE, TO HIM
I


   WHEN you shall see me in the toils of Time,
   My lauded beauties carried off from me,
   My eyes no longer stars as in their prime,
   My name forgot of Maiden Fair and Free;

   When in your being heart concedes to mind,
   And judgment, though you scarce its process know,
   Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined,
   And you are irked that they have withered so:

   Remembering that with me lies not the blame,
   That Sportsman Time but rears his brood to kill,
   Knowing me in my soul the very same—
   One who would die to spare you touch of ill!—
   Will you not grant to old affection’s claim
   The hand of friendship down Life’s sunless hill?

1866.




SHE, TO HIM
II


   PERHAPS, long hence, when I have passed away,
   Some other’s feature, accent, thought like mine,
   Will carry you back to what I used to say,
   And bring some memory of your love’s decline.

   Then you may pause awhile and think, “Poor jade!”
   And yield a sigh to me—as ample due,
   Not as the tittle of a debt unpaid
   To one who could resign her all to you—

   And thus reflecting, you will never see
   That your thin thought, in two small words conveyed,
   Was no such fleeting phantom-thought to me,
   But the Whole Life wherein my part was played;
   And you amid its fitful masquerade
   A Thought—as I in yours but seem to be.

1866.




SHE, TO HIM
III


   I WILL be faithful to thee; aye, I will!
   And Death shall choose me with a wondering eye
   That he did not discern and domicile
   One his by right ever since that last Good-bye!

   I have no care for friends, or kin, or prime
   Of manhood who deal gently with me here;
   Amid the happy people of my time
   Who work their love’s fulfilment, I appear

   Numb as a vane that cankers on its point,
   True to the wind that kissed ere canker came;
   Despised by souls of Now, who would disjoint
   The mind from memory, and make Life all aim,

   My old dexterities of hue quite gone,
   And nothing left for Love to look upon.

1866.




SHE, TO HIM
IV


   This love puts all humanity from me;
   I can but maledict her, pray her dead,
   For giving love and getting love of thee—
   Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed!

   How much I love I know not, life not known,
   Save as some unit I would add love by;
   But this I know, my being is but thine own—
   Fused from its separateness by ecstasy.

   And thus I grasp thy amplitudes, of her
   Ungrasped, though helped by nigh-regarding eyes;
   Canst thou then hate me as an envier
   Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize?
   Believe me, Lost One, Love is lovelier
   The more it shapes its moan in selfish-wise.

1866.




DITTY
(E. L G.)


   BENEATH a knap where flown
      Nestlings play,
   Within walls of weathered stone,
      Far away
   From the files of formal houses,
   By the bough the firstling browses,
   Lives a Sweet: no merchants meet,
   No man barters, no man sells
      Where she dwells.

   Upon that fabric fair
      “Here is she!”
   Seems written everywhere
      Unto me.
   But to friends and nodding neighbours,
   Fellow-wights in lot and labours,
   Who descry the times as I,
   No such lucid legend tells
      Where she dwells.

   Should I lapse to what I was
      Ere we met;
   (Such can not be, but because
      Some forget
   Let me feign it)—none would notice
   That where she I know by rote is
   Spread a strange and withering change,
   Like a drying of the wells
      Where she dwells.

   To feel I might have kissed—
      Loved as true—
   Otherwhere, nor Mine have missed
      My life through.
   Had I never wandered near her,
   Is a smart severe—severer
   In the thought that she is nought,
   Even as I, beyond the dells
      Where she dwells.

   And Devotion droops her glance
      To recall
   What bond-servants of Chance
      We are all.
   I but found her in that, going
   On my errant path unknowing,
   I did not out-skirt the spot
   That no spot on earth excels,
      —Where she dwells!

1870.





THE SERGEANT’S SONG
(1803)


   WHEN Lawyers strive to heal a breach,
   And Parsons practise what they preach;
   Then Little Boney he’ll pounce down,
   And march his men on London town!
      Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lorum,
      Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lay!

   When Justices hold equal scales,
   And Rogues are only found in jails;
   Then Little Boney he’ll pounce down,
   And march his men on London town!
      Rollicum-rorum, &c.

   When Rich Men find their wealth a curse,
   And fill therewith the Poor Man’s purse;
   Then Little Boney he’ll pounce down,
   And march his men on London town!
      Rollicum-rorum, &c.

   When Husbands with their Wives agree,
   And Maids won’t wed from modesty;
   Then Little Boney he’ll pounce down,
   And march his men on London town!
      Rollicum-rorum, tol-tol-lorum,
      Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lay!

VALENCIENNES
(1793)


             BY CORP’L TULLIDGE: _see_ “_The Trumpet-Major_”
                IN MEMORY OF S. C. (PENSIONER).  DIED 184–

      WE trenched, we trumpeted and drummed,
   And from our mortars tons of iron hummed
      Ath’art the ditch, the month we bombed
         The Town o’ Valencieën.

      ’Twas in the June o’ Ninety-dree
   (The Duke o’ Yark our then Commander been)
      The German Legion, Guards, and we
         Laid siege to Valencieën.

      This was the first time in the war
   That French and English spilled each other’s gore;
      —Few dreamt how far would roll the roar
         Begun at Valencieën!

      ’Twas said that we’d no business there
   A-topperèn the French for disagreën;
      However, that’s not my affair—
         We were at Valencieën.

      Such snocks and slats, since war began
   Never knew raw recruit or veteran:
      Stone-deaf therence went many a man
         Who served at Valencieën.

      Into the streets, ath’art the sky,
   A hundred thousand balls and bombs were fleën;
      And harmless townsfolk fell to die
         Each hour at Valencieën!

      And, sweatèn wi’ the bombardiers,
   A shell was slent to shards anighst my ears:
      —’Twas nigh the end of hopes and fears
         For me at Valencieën!

      They bore my wownded frame to camp,
   And shut my gapèn skull, and washed en cleän,
      And jined en wi’ a zilver clamp
         Thik night at Valencieën.

      “We’ve fetched en back to quick from dead;
   But never more on earth while rose is red
      Will drum rouse Corpel!” Doctor said
         O’ me at Valencieën.

      ’Twer true.  No voice o’ friend or foe
   Can reach me now, or any livèn beën;
      And little have I power to know
         Since then at Valencieën!

      I never hear the zummer hums
   O’ bees; and don’ know when the cuckoo comes;
      But night and day I hear the bombs
         We threw at Valencieën . . .

      As for the Duke o’ Yark in war,
   There be some volk whose judgment o’ en is mean;
      But this I say—a was not far
         From great at Valencieën.

      O’ wild wet nights, when all seems sad,
   My wownds come back, as though new wownds I’d had;
      But yet—at times I’m sort o’ glad
         I fout at Valencieën.

      Well: Heaven wi’ its jasper halls
   Is now the on’y Town I care to be in . . .
      Good Lord, if Nick should bomb the walls
         As we did Valencieën!

1878–1897.




SAN SEBASTIAN
(August 1813)


         WITH THOUGHTS OF SERGEANT M— (PENSIONER), WHO DIED 185–.

   “WHY, Sergeant, stray on the Ivel Way,
   As though at home there were spectres rife?
   From first to last ’twas a proud career!
   And your sunny years with a gracious wife
      Have brought you a daughter dear.

   “I watched her to-day; a more comely maid,
   As she danced in her muslin bowed with blue,
   Round a Hintock maypole never gayed.”
   —“Aye, aye; I watched her this day, too,
      As it happens,” the Sergeant said.

   “My daughter is now,” he again began,
   “Of just such an age as one I knew
   When we of the Line and Forlorn-hope van,
   On an August morning—a chosen few—
      Stormed San Sebastian.

   “She’s a score less three; so about was _she_—
   The maiden I wronged in Peninsular days . . .
   You may prate of your prowess in lusty times,
   But as years gnaw inward you blink your bays,
      And see too well your crimes!

   “We’d stormed it at night, by the vlanker-light
   Of burning towers, and the mortar’s boom:
   We’d topped the breach; but had failed to stay,
   For our files were misled by the baffling gloom;
      And we said we’d storm by day.

   “So, out of the trenches, with features set,
   On that hot, still morning, in measured pace,
   Our column climbed; climbed higher yet,
   Past the fauss’bray, scarp, up the curtain-face,
      And along the parapet.

   “From the battened hornwork the cannoneers
   Hove crashing balls of iron fire;
   On the shaking gap mount the volunteers
   In files, and as they mount expire
      Amid curses, groans, and cheers.

   “Five hours did we storm, five hours re-form,
   As Death cooled those hot blood pricked on;
   Till our cause was helped by a woe within:
   They swayed from the summit we’d leapt upon,
      And madly we entered in.

   “On end for plunder, ’mid rain and thunder
   That burst with the lull of our cannonade,
   We vamped the streets in the stifling air—
   Our hunger unsoothed, our thirst unstayed—
      And ransacked the buildings there.

   “Down the stony steps of the house-fronts white
   We rolled rich puncheons of Spanish grape,
   Till at length, with the fire of the wine alight,
   I saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape—
      A woman, a sylph, or sprite.

   “Afeard she fled, and with heated head
   I pursued to the chamber she called her own;
   —When might is right no qualms deter,
   And having her helpless and alone
      I wreaked my will on her.

   “She raised her beseeching eyes to me,
   And I heard the words of prayer she sent
   In her own soft language . . . Seemingly
   I copied those eyes for my punishment
      In begetting the girl you see!

   “So, to-day I stand with a God-set brand
   Like Cain’s, when he wandered from kindred’s ken . . .
   I served through the war that made Europe free;
   I wived me in peace-year.  But, hid from men,
      I bear that mark on me.

   “And I nightly stray on the Ivel Way
   As though at home there were spectres rife;
   I delight me not in my proud career;
   And ’tis coals of fire that a gracious wife
      Should have brought me a daughter dear!”




THE STRANGER’S SONG


    (_As sung by_ MR. CHARLES CHARRINGTON _in the play of_ “_The Three
                               Wayfarers_”)

               O MY trade it is the rarest one,
   Simple shepherds all—
         My trade is a sight to see;
   For my customers I tie, and take ’em up on high,
      And waft ’em to a far countree!

   My tools are but common ones,
               Simple shepherds all—
         My tools are no sight to see:
   A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing,
      Are implements enough for me!

   To-morrow is my working day,
            Simple shepherds all—
         To-morrow is a working day for me:
   For the farmer’s sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta’en,
      And on his soul may God ha’ mer-cy!

THE BURGHERS
(17–)


   THE sun had wheeled from Grey’s to Dammer’s Crest,
   And still I mused on that Thing imminent:
   At length I sought the High-street to the West.

   The level flare raked pane and pediment
   And my wrecked face, and shaped my nearing friend
   Like one of those the Furnace held unshent.

   “I’ve news concerning her,” he said.  “Attend.
   They fly to-night at the late moon’s first gleam:
   Watch with thy steel: two righteous thrusts will end

   Her shameless visions and his passioned dream.
   I’ll watch with thee, to testify thy wrong—
   To aid, maybe.—Law consecrates the scheme.”

   I started, and we paced the flags along
   Till I replied: “Since it has come to this
   I’ll do it!  But alone.  I can be strong.”

   Three hours past Curfew, when the Froom’s mild hiss
   Reigned sole, undulled by whirr of merchandize,
   From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is,

   I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd’path Rise,
   And stood beneath the wall.  Eleven strokes went,
   And to the door they came, contrariwise,

   And met in clasp so close I had but bent
   My lifted blade upon them to have let
   Their two souls loose upon the firmament.

   But something held my arm.  “A moment yet
   As pray-time ere you wantons die!” I said;
   And then they saw me.  Swift her gaze was set

   With eye and cry of love illimited
   Upon her Heart-king.  Never upon me
   Had she thrown look of love so thorough-sped! . . .

   At once she flung her faint form shieldingly
   On his, against the vengeance of my vows;
   The which o’erruling, her shape shielded he.

   Blanked by such love, I stood as in a drowse,
   And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh,
   My sad thoughts moving thuswise: “I may house

   And I may husband her, yet what am I
   But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair?
   Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by.” . . .

   Hurling my iron to the bushes there,
   I bade them stay.  And, as if brain and breast
   Were passive, they walked with me to the stair.

   Inside the house none watched; and on we prest
   Before a mirror, in whose gleam I read
   Her beauty, his,—and mine own mien unblest;

   Till at her room I turned.  “Madam,” I said,
   “Have you the wherewithal for this?  Pray speak.
   Love fills no cupboard.  You’ll need daily bread.”

   “We’ve nothing, sire,” said she; “and nothing seek.
   ’Twere base in me to rob my lord unware;
   Our hands will earn a pittance week by week.”

   And next I saw she’d piled her raiment rare
   Within the garde-robes, and her household purse,
   Her jewels, and least lace of personal wear;

   And stood in homespun.  Now grown wholly hers,
   I handed her the gold, her jewels all,
   And him the choicest of her robes diverse.

   “I’ll take you to the doorway in the wall,
   And then adieu,” I to them.  “Friends, withdraw.”
   They did so; and she went—beyond recall.

   And as I paused beneath the arch I saw
   Their moonlit figures—slow, as in surprise—
   Descend the slope, and vanish on the haw.

   “‘Fool,’ some will say,” I thought.  “But who is wise,
   Save God alone, to weigh my reasons why?”
   —“Hast thou struck home?” came with the boughs’ night-sighs.

   It was my friend.  “I have struck well.  They fly,
   But carry wounds that none can cicatrize.”
   —“Not mortal?” said he.  “Lingering—worse,” said I.




LEIPZIG
(1813)


      _Scene_: _The Master-tradesmen’s Parlour at the Old Ship Inn_,
                       _Casterbridge_.  _Evening_.

   “OLD Norbert with the flat blue cap—
      A German said to be—
   Why let your pipe die on your lap,
      Your eyes blink absently?”—

   —“Ah! . . . Well, I had thought till my cheek was wet
      Of my mother—her voice and mien
   When she used to sing and pirouette,
      And touse the tambourine

   “To the march that yon street-fiddler plies:
      She told me ’twas the same
   She’d heard from the trumpets, when the Allies
      Her city overcame.

   “My father was one of the German Hussars,
      My mother of Leipzig; but he,
   Long quartered here, fetched her at close of the wars,
      And a Wessex lad reared me.

   “And as I grew up, again and again
      She’d tell, after trilling that air,
   Of her youth, and the battles on Leipzig plain
      And of all that was suffered there! . . .

   “—’Twas a time of alarms.  Three Chiefs-at-arms
      Combined them to crush One,
   And by numbers’ might, for in equal fight
      He stood the matched of none.

   “Carl Schwarzenberg was of the plot,
      And Blücher, prompt and prow,
   And Jean the Crown-Prince Bernadotte:
      Buonaparte was the foe.

   “City and plain had felt his reign
      From the North to the Middle Sea,
   And he’d now sat down in the noble town
      Of the King of Saxony.

   “October’s deep dew its wet gossamer threw
      Upon Leipzig’s lawns, leaf-strewn,
   Where lately each fair avenue
      Wrought shade for summer noon.

   “To westward two dull rivers crept
      Through miles of marsh and slough,
   Whereover a streak of whiteness swept—
      The Bridge of Lindenau.

   “Hard by, in the City, the One, care-tossed,
      Gloomed over his shrunken power;
   And without the walls the hemming host
      Waxed denser every hour.

   “He had speech that night on the morrow’s designs
      With his chiefs by the bivouac fire,
   While the belt of flames from the enemy’s lines
      Flared nigher him yet and nigher.

   “Three sky-lights then from the girdling trine
      Told, ‘Ready!’  As they rose
   Their flashes seemed his Judgment-Sign
      For bleeding Europe’s woes.

   “’Twas seen how the French watch-fires that night
      Glowed still and steadily;
   And the Three rejoiced, for they read in the sight
      That the One disdained to flee . . .

   “—Five hundred guns began the affray
      On next day morn at nine;
   Such mad and mangling cannon-play
      Had never torn human line.

   “Around the town three battles beat,
      Contracting like a gin;
   As nearer marched the million feet
      Of columns closing in.

   “The first battle nighed on the low Southern side;
      The second by the Western way;
   The nearing of the third on the North was heard:
      —The French held all at bay.

   “Against the first band did the Emperor stand;
      Against the second stood Ney;
   Marmont against the third gave the order-word:
      —Thus raged it throughout the day.

   “Fifty thousand sturdy souls on those trampled plains and knolls,
      Who met the dawn hopefully,
   And were lotted their shares in a quarrel not theirs,
      Dropt then in their agony.

   “‘O,’ the old folks said, ‘ye Preachers stern!
      O so-called Christian time!
   When will men’s swords to ploughshares turn?
      When come the promised prime?’ . . .

   “—The clash of horse and man which that day began,
      Closed not as evening wore;
   And the morrow’s armies, rear and van,
      Still mustered more and more.

   “From the City towers the Confederate Powers
      Were eyed in glittering lines,
   And up from the vast a murmuring passed
      As from a wood of pines.

   “‘’Tis well to cover a feeble skill
      By numbers!’ scoffèd He;
   ‘But give me a third of their strength, I’d fill
      Half Hell with their soldiery!’

   “All that day raged the war they waged,
      And again dumb night held reign,
   Save that ever upspread from the dark deathbed
      A miles-wide pant of pain.

   “Hard had striven brave Ney, the true Bertrand,
      Victor, and Augereau,
   Bold Poniatowski, and Lauriston,
      To stay their overthrow;

   “But, as in the dream of one sick to death
      There comes a narrowing room
   That pens him, body and limbs and breath,
      To wait a hideous doom,

   “So to Napoleon, in the hush
      That held the town and towers
   Through these dire nights, a creeping crush
      Seemed inborne with the hours.

   “One road to the rearward, and but one,
      Did fitful Chance allow;
   ’Twas where the Pleiss’ and Elster run—
      The Bridge of Lindenau.

   “The nineteenth dawned.  Down street and Platz
      The wasted French sank back,
   Stretching long lines across the Flats
      And on the bridge-way track;

   “When there surged on the sky an earthen wave,
      And stones, and men, as though
   Some rebel churchyard crew updrave
      Their sepulchres from below.

   “To Heaven is blown Bridge Lindenau;
      Wrecked regiments reel therefrom;
   And rank and file in masses plough
      The sullen Elster-Strom.

   “A gulf was Lindenau; and dead
      Were fifties, hundreds, tens;
   And every current rippled red
      With Marshal’s blood and men’s.

   “The smart Macdonald swam therein,
      And barely won the verge;
   Bold Poniatowski plunged him in
      Never to re-emerge.

   “Then stayed the strife.  The remnants wound
      Their Rhineward way pell-mell;
   And thus did Leipzig City sound
      An Empire’s passing bell;

   “While in cavalcade, with band and blade,
      Came Marshals, Princes, Kings;
   And the town was theirs . . . Ay, as simple maid,
      My mother saw these things!

   “And whenever those notes in the street begin,
      I recall her, and that far scene,
   And her acting of how the Allies marched in,
      And her touse of the tambourine!”





THE PEASANT’S CONFESSION


    “Si le maréchal Grouchy avait été rejoint par l’officier que Napoléon
    lui avait expédié la veille à dix heures du soir, toute question eût
    disparu.  Mais cet officier n’était point parvenu à sa destination,
    ainsi que le maréchal n’a cessé de l’affirmer toute sa vie, et il
    faut l’en croire, car autrement il n’aurait eu aucune raison pour
    hésiter.  Cet officier avait-il été pris? avait-il passé à l’ennemi?
    C’est ce qu’on a toujours ignoré.”

                             —THIERS: _Histoire de l’Empire_.  “Waterloo.”

   GOOD Father! . . . ’Twas an eve in middle June,
      And war was waged anew
   By great Napoleon, who for years had strewn
      Men’s bones all Europe through.

   Three nights ere this, with columned corps he’d crossed
      The Sambre at Charleroi,
   To move on Brussels, where the English host
      Dallied in Parc and Bois.

   The yestertide we’d heard the gloomy gun
      Growl through the long-sunned day
   From Quatre-Bras and Ligny; till the dun
      Twilight suppressed the fray;

   Albeit therein—as lated tongues bespoke—
      Brunswick’s high heart was drained,
   And Prussia’s Line and Landwehr, though unbroke,
      Stood cornered and constrained.

   And at next noon-time Grouchy slowly passed
      With thirty thousand men:
   We hoped thenceforth no army, small or vast,
      Would trouble us again.

   My hut lay deeply in a vale recessed,
      And never a soul seemed nigh
   When, reassured at length, we went to rest—
      My children, wife, and I.

   But what was this that broke our humble ease?
      What noise, above the rain,
   Above the dripping of the poplar trees
      That smote along the pane?

   —A call of mastery, bidding me arise,
      Compelled me to the door,
   At which a horseman stood in martial guise—
      Splashed—sweating from every pore.

   Had I seen Grouchy?  Yes?  Which track took he?
      Could I lead thither on?—
   Fulfilment would ensure gold pieces three,
      Perchance more gifts anon.

   “I bear the Emperor’s mandate,” then he said,
      “Charging the Marshal straight
   To strike between the double host ahead
      Ere they co-operate,

   “Engaging Blücher till the Emperor put
      Lord Wellington to flight,
   And next the Prussians.  This to set afoot
      Is my emprise to-night.”

   I joined him in the mist; but, pausing, sought
      To estimate his say.
   Grouchy had made for Wavre; and yet, on thought,
      I did not lead that way.

   I mused: “If Grouchy thus instructed be,
      The clash comes sheer hereon;
   My farm is stript.  While, as for pieces three,
      Money the French have none.

   “Grouchy unwarned, moreo’er, the English win,
      And mine is left to me—
   They buy, not borrow.”—Hence did I begin
      To lead him treacherously.

   By Joidoigne, near to east, as we ondrew,
      Dawn pierced the humid air;
   And eastward faced I with him, though I knew
      Never marched Grouchy there.

   Near Ottignies we passed, across the Dyle
      (Lim’lette left far aside),
   And thence direct toward Pervez and Noville
      Through green grain, till he cried:

   “I doubt thy conduct, man! no track is here—
      I doubt thy gagèd word!”
   Thereat he scowled on me, and pranced me near,
      And pricked me with his sword.

   “Nay, Captain, hold!  We skirt, not trace the course
      Of Grouchy,” said I then:
   “As we go, yonder went he, with his force
      Of thirty thousand men.”

   —At length noon nighed; when west, from Saint-John’s-Mound,
      A hoarse artillery boomed,
   And from Saint-Lambert’s upland, chapel-crowned,
      The Prussian squadrons loomed.

   Then to the wayless wet gray ground he leapt;
      “My mission fails!” he cried;
   “Too late for Grouchy now to intercept,
      For, peasant, you have lied!”

   He turned to pistol me.  I sprang, and drew
      The sabre from his flank,
   And ’twixt his nape and shoulder, ere he knew,
      I struck, and dead he sank.

   I hid him deep in nodding rye and oat—
      His shroud green stalks and loam;
   His requiem the corn-blade’s husky note—
      And then I hastened home, . . .

   —Two armies writhe in coils of red and blue,
      And brass and iron clang
   From Goumont, past the front of Waterloo,
      To Pap’lotte and Smohain.

   The Guard Imperial wavered on the height;
      The Emperor’s face grew glum;
   “I sent,” he said, “to Grouchy yesternight,
      And yet he does not come!”

   ’Twas then, Good Father, that the French espied,
      Streaking the summer land,
   The men of Blücher.  But the Emperor cried,
      “Grouchy is now at hand!”

   And meanwhile Vand’leur, Vivian, Maitland, Kempt,
      Met d’Erlon, Friant, Ney;
   But Grouchy—mis-sent, blamed, yet blame-exempt—
      Grouchy was far away.

   By even, slain or struck, Michel the strong,
      Bold Travers, Dnop, Delord,
   Smart Guyot, Reil-le, l’Heriter, Friant,
      Scattered that champaign o’er.

   Fallen likewise wronged Duhesme, and skilled Lobau
      Did that red sunset see;
   Colbert, Legros, Blancard! . . . And of the foe
      Picton and Ponsonby;

   With Gordon, Canning, Blackman, Ompteda,
      L’Estrange, Delancey, Packe,
   Grose, D’Oyly, Stables, Morice, Howard, Hay,
      Von Schwerin, Watzdorf, Boek,

   Smith, Phelips, Fuller, Lind, and Battersby,
      And hosts of ranksmen round . . .
   Memorials linger yet to speak to thee
      Of those that bit the ground!

   The Guards’ last column yielded; dykes of dead
      Lay between vale and ridge,
   As, thinned yet closing, faint yet fierce, they sped
      In packs to Genappe Bridge.

   Safe was my stock; my capple cow unslain;
         Intact each cock and hen;
   But Grouchy far at Wavre all day had lain,
      And thirty thousand men.

   O Saints, had I but lost my earing corn
      And saved the cause once prized!
   O Saints, why such false witness had I borne
      When late I’d sympathized! . . .

   So now, being old, my children eye askance
      My slowly dwindling store,
   And crave my mite; till, worn with tarriance,
      I care for life no more.

   To Almighty God henceforth I stand confessed,
      And Virgin-Saint Marie;
   O Michael, John, and Holy Ones in rest,
      Entreat the Lord for me!





THE ALARM
(1803)


                       _See_ “_The Trumpet-Major_”

            IN MEMORY OF ONE OF THE WRITER’S FAMILY WHO WAS A
                  VOLUNTEER DURING THE WAR WITH NAPOLEON

         IN a ferny byway
         Near the great South-Wessex Highway,
      A homestead raised its breakfast-smoke aloft;
   The dew-damps still lay steamless, for the sun had made no sky-way,
         And twilight cloaked the croft.

         ’Twas hard to realize on
         This snug side the mute horizon
      That beyond it hostile armaments might steer,
   Save from seeing in the porchway a fair woman weep with eyes on
         A harnessed Volunteer.

         In haste he’d flown there
         To his comely wife alone there,
      While marching south hard by, to still her fears,
   For she soon would be a mother, and few messengers were known there
         In these campaigning years.

         ’Twas time to be Good-bying,
         Since the assembly-hour was nighing
      In royal George’s town at six that morn;
   And betwixt its wharves and this retreat were ten good miles of hieing
      Ere ring of bugle-horn.

         “I’ve laid in food, Dear,
         And broached the spiced and brewed, Dear;
      And if our July hope should antedate,
   Let the char-wench mount and gallop by the halterpath and wood, Dear,
         And fetch assistance straight.

         “As for Buonaparte, forget him;
         He’s not like to land!  But let him,
      Those strike with aim who strike for wives and sons!
   And the war-boats built to float him; ’twere but wanted to upset him
         A slat from Nelson’s guns!

         “But, to assure thee,
         And of creeping fears to cure thee,
      If he _should_ be rumoured anchoring in the Road,
   Drive with the nurse to Kingsbere; and let nothing thence allure thee
         Till we’ve him safe-bestowed.

         “Now, to turn to marching matters:—
         I’ve my knapsack, firelock, spatters,
      Crossbelts, priming-horn, stock, bay’net, blackball, clay,
   Pouch, magazine, flints, flint-box that at every quick-step clatters;
      . . . My heart, Dear; that must stay!”

         —With breathings broken
         Farewell was kissed unspoken,
      And they parted there as morning stroked the panes;
   And the Volunteer went on, and turned, and twirled his glove for
   token,
      And took the coastward lanes.

         When above He’th Hills he found him,
         He saw, on gazing round him,
      The Barrow-Beacon burning—burning low,
   As if, perhaps, uplighted ever since he’d homeward bound him;
         And it meant: Expect the Foe!

         Leaving the byway,
         And following swift the highway,
      Car and chariot met he, faring fast inland;
   “He’s anchored, Soldier!” shouted some: “God save thee, marching thy
   way,
      Th’lt front him on the strand!”

         He slowed; he stopped; he paltered
         Awhile with self, and faltered,
      “Why courting misadventure shoreward roam?
   To Molly, surely!  Seek the woods with her till times have altered;
         Charity favours home.

         “Else, my denying
         He would come she’ll read as lying—
      Think the Barrow-Beacon must have met my eyes—
   That my words were not unwareness, but deceit of her, while trying
         My life to jeopardize.

         “At home is stocked provision,
         And to-night, without suspicion,
      We might bear it with us to a covert near;
   Such sin, to save a childing wife, would earn it Christ’s remission,
      Though none forgive it here!”

         While thus he, thinking,
         A little bird, quick drinking
      Among the crowfoot tufts the river bore,
   Was tangled in their stringy arms, and fluttered, well-nigh sinking,
      Near him, upon the moor.

         He stepped in, reached, and seized it,
         And, preening, had released it
      But that a thought of Holy Writ occurred,
   And Signs Divine ere battle, till it seemed him Heaven had pleased it
      As guide to send the bird.

         “O Lord, direct me! . . .
         Doth Duty now expect me
      To march a-coast, or guard my weak ones near?
   Give this bird a flight according, that I thence know to elect me
      The southward or the rear.”

         He loosed his clasp; when, rising,
         The bird—as if surmising—
      Bore due to southward, crossing by the Froom,
   And Durnover Great-Field and Fort, the soldier clear advising—
         Prompted he wist by Whom.

         Then on he panted
         By grim Mai-Don, and slanted
      Up the steep Ridge-way, hearkening betwixt whiles;
   Till, nearing coast and harbour, he beheld the shore-line planted
      With Foot and Horse for miles.

         Mistrusting not the omen,
         He gained the beach, where Yeomen,
      Militia, Fencibles, and Pikemen bold,
   With Regulars in thousands, were enmassed to meet the Foemen,
      Whose fleet had not yet shoaled.

         Captain and Colonel,
         Sere Generals, Ensigns vernal,
      Were there; of neighbour-natives, Michel, Smith,
   Meggs, Bingham, Gambier, Cunningham, roused by the hued nocturnal
      Swoop on their land and kith.

         But Buonaparte still tarried;
         His project had miscarried;
      At the last hour, equipped for victory,
   The fleet had paused; his subtle combinations had been parried
      By British strategy.

         Homeward returning
         Anon, no beacons burning,
      No alarms, the Volunteer, in modest bliss,
   Te Deum sang with wife and friends: “We praise Thee, Lord, discerning
         That Thou hast helped in this!”




HER DEATH AND AFTER


   ’TWAS a death-bed summons, and forth I went
   By the way of the Western Wall, so drear
   On that winter night, and sought a gate—
         The home, by Fate,
      Of one I had long held dear.

   And there, as I paused by her tenement,
   And the trees shed on me their rime and hoar,
   I thought of the man who had left her lone—
         Him who made her his own
      When I loved her, long before.

   The rooms within had the piteous shine
   That home-things wear when there’s aught amiss;
   From the stairway floated the rise and fall
         Of an infant’s call,
      Whose birth had brought her to this.

   Her life was the price she would pay for that whine—
   For a child by the man she did not love.
   “But let that rest for ever,” I said,
         And bent my tread
      To the chamber up above.

   She took my hand in her thin white own,
   And smiled her thanks—though nigh too weak—
   And made them a sign to leave us there
         Then faltered, ere
      She could bring herself to speak.

   “’Twas to see you before I go—he’ll condone
   Such a natural thing now my time’s not much—
   When Death is so near it hustles hence
         All passioned sense
      Between woman and man as such!

   “My husband is absent.  As heretofore
   The City detains him.  But, in truth,
   He has not been kind . . . I will speak no blame,
         But—the child is lame;
      O, I pray she may reach his ruth!

   “Forgive past days—I can say no more—
   Maybe if we’d wedded you’d now repine! . . .
   But I treated you ill.  I was punished.  Farewell!
         —Truth shall I tell?
      Would the child were yours and mine!

   “As a wife I was true.  But, such my unease
   That, could I insert a deed back in Time,
   I’d make her yours, to secure your care;
         And the scandal bear,
      And the penalty for the crime!”

   —When I had left, and the swinging trees
   Rang above me, as lauding her candid say,
   Another was I.  Her words were enough:
         Came smooth, came rough,
      I felt I could live my day.

   Next night she died; and her obsequies
   In the Field of Tombs, by the Via renowned,
   Had her husband’s heed.  His tendance spent,
         I often went
      And pondered by her mound.

   All that year and the next year whiled,
   And I still went thitherward in the gloam;
   But the Town forgot her and her nook,
         And her husband took
      Another Love to his home.

   And the rumour flew that the lame lone child
   Whom she wished for its safety child of mine,
   Was treated ill when offspring came
         Of the new-made dame,
      And marked a more vigorous line.

   A smarter grief within me wrought
   Than even at loss of her so dear;
   Dead the being whose soul my soul suffused,
         Her child ill-used,
      I helpless to interfere!

   One eve as I stood at my spot of thought
   In the white-stoned Garth, brooding thus her wrong,
   Her husband neared; and to shun his view
         By her hallowed mew
      I went from the tombs among

   To the Cirque of the Gladiators which faced—
   That haggard mark of Imperial Rome,
   Whose Pagan echoes mock the chime
         Of our Christian time:
      It was void, and I inward clomb.

   Scarce night the sun’s gold touch displaced
   From the vast Rotund and the neighbouring dead
   When her husband followed; bowed; half-passed,
         With lip upcast;
      Then, halting, sullenly said:

   “It is noised that you visit my first wife’s tomb.
   Now, I gave her an honoured name to bear
   While living, when dead.  So I’ve claim to ask
         By what right you task
      My patience by vigiling there?

   “There’s decency even in death, I assume;
   Preserve it, sir, and keep away;
   For the mother of my first-born you
         Show mind undue!
      —Sir, I’ve nothing more to say.”

   A desperate stroke discerned I then—
   God pardon—or pardon not—the lie;
   She had sighed that she wished (lest the child should pine
         Of slights) ’twere mine,
      So I said: “But the father I.

   “That you thought it yours is the way of men;
   But I won her troth long ere your day:
   You learnt how, in dying, she summoned me?
         ’Twas in fealty.
      —Sir, I’ve nothing more to say,

   “Save that, if you’ll hand me my little maid,
   I’ll take her, and rear her, and spare you toil.
   Think it more than a friendly act none can;
         I’m a lonely man,
      While you’ve a large pot to boil.

   “If not, and you’ll put it to ball or blade—
   To-night, to-morrow night, anywhen—
   I’ll meet you here . . . But think of it,
         And in season fit
      Let me hear from you again.”

   —Well, I went away, hoping; but nought I heard
   Of my stroke for the child, till there greeted me
   A little voice that one day came
         To my window-frame
      And babbled innocently:

   “My father who’s not my own, sends word
   I’m to stay here, sir, where I belong!”
   Next a writing came: “Since the child was the fruit
         Of your lawless suit,
      Pray take her, to right a wrong.”

   And I did.  And I gave the child my love,
   And the child loved me, and estranged us none.
   But compunctions loomed; for I’d harmed the dead
         By what I’d said
      For the good of the living one.

   —Yet though, God wot, I am sinner enough,
   And unworthy the woman who drew me so,
   Perhaps this wrong for her darling’s good
         She forgives, or would,
      If only she could know!





THE DANCE AT THE PHŒNIX


   TO Jenny came a gentle youth
      From inland leazes lone,
   His love was fresh as apple-blooth
      By Parrett, Yeo, or Tone.
   And duly he entreated her
   To be his tender minister,
      And call him aye her own.

   Fair Jenny’s life had hardly been
      A life of modesty;
   At Casterbridge experience keen
      Of many loves had she
   From scarcely sixteen years above;
   Among them sundry troopers of
      The King’s-Own Cavalry.

   But each with charger, sword, and gun,
      Had bluffed the Biscay wave;
   And Jenny prized her gentle one
      For all the love he gave.
   She vowed to be, if they were wed,
   His honest wife in heart and head
      From bride-ale hour to grave.

   Wedded they were.  Her husband’s trust
      In Jenny knew no bound,
   And Jenny kept her pure and just,
      Till even malice found
   No sin or sign of ill to be
   In one who walked so decently
      The duteous helpmate’s round.

   Two sons were born, and bloomed to men,
      And roamed, and were as not:
   Alone was Jenny left again
      As ere her mind had sought
   A solace in domestic joys,
   And ere the vanished pair of boys
      Were sent to sun her cot.

   She numbered near on sixty years,
      And passed as elderly,
   When, in the street, with flush of fears,
      One day discovered she,
   From shine of swords and thump of drum.
   Her early loves from war had come,
      The King’s-Own Cavalry.

   She turned aside, and bowed her head
      Anigh Saint Peter’s door;
   “Alas for chastened thoughts!” she said;
      “I’m faded now, and hoar,
   And yet those notes—they thrill me through,
   And those gay forms move me anew
      As in the years of yore!” . . .

   ’Twas Christmas, and the Phœnix Inn
      Was lit with tapers tall,
   For thirty of the trooper men
      Had vowed to give a ball
   As “Theirs” had done (’twas handed down)
   When lying in the selfsame town
      Ere Buonaparté’s fall.

   That night the throbbing “Soldier’s Joy,”
      The measured tread and sway
   Of “Fancy-Lad” and “Maiden Coy,”
      Reached Jenny as she lay
   Beside her spouse; till springtide blood
   Seemed scouring through her like a flood
      That whisked the years away.

   She rose, and rayed, and decked her head
      Where the bleached hairs ran thin;
   Upon her cap two bows of red
      She fixed with hasty pin;
   Unheard descending to the street,
   She trod the flags with tune-led feet,
      And stood before the Inn.

   Save for the dancers’, not a sound
      Disturbed the icy air;
   No watchman on his midnight round
      Or traveller was there;
   But over All-Saints’, high and bright,
   Pulsed to the music Sirius white,
      The Wain by Bullstake Square.

   She knocked, but found her further stride
      Checked by a sergeant tall:
   “Gay Granny, whence come you?” he cried;
      “This is a private ball.”
   —“No one has more right here than me!
   Ere you were born, man,” answered she,
      “I knew the regiment all!”

   “Take not the lady’s visit ill!”
      Upspoke the steward free;
   “We lack sufficient partners still,
      So, prithee let her be!”
   They seized and whirled her ’mid the maze,
   And Jenny felt as in the days
      Of her immodesty.

   Hour chased each hour, and night advanced;
      She sped as shod with wings;
   Each time and every time she danced—
      Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings:
   They cheered her as she soared and swooped,
   (She’d learnt ere art in dancing drooped
      From hops to slothful swings).

   The favourite Quick-step “Speed the Plough”—
      (Cross hands, cast off, and wheel)—
   “The Triumph,” “Sylph,” “The Row-dow-dow,”
      Famed “Major Malley’s Reel,”
   “The Duke of York’s,” “The Fairy Dance,”
   “The Bridge of Lodi” (brought from France),
      She beat out, toe and heel.

   The “Fall of Paris” clanged its close,
      And Peter’s chime told four,
   When Jenny, bosom-beating, rose
      To seek her silent door.
   They tiptoed in escorting her,
   Lest stroke of heel or clink of spur
      Should break her goodman’s snore.

   The fire that late had burnt fell slack
      When lone at last stood she;
   Her nine-and-fifty years came back;
      She sank upon her knee
   Beside the durn, and like a dart
   A something arrowed through her heart
      In shoots of agony.

   Their footsteps died as she leant there,
      Lit by the morning star
   Hanging above the moorland, where
      The aged elm-rows are;
   And, as o’ernight, from Pummery Ridge
   To Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge
      No life stirred, near or far.

   Though inner mischief worked amain,
      She reached her husband’s side;
   Where, toil-weary, as he had lain
      Beneath the patchwork pied
   When yestereve she’d forthward crept,
   And as unwitting, still he slept
      Who did in her confide.

   A tear sprang as she turned and viewed
      His features free from guile;
   She kissed him long, as when, just wooed,
      She chose his domicile.
   She felt she could have given her life
   To be the single-hearted wife
      That she had been erstwhile.

   Time wore to six.  Her husband rose
      And struck the steel and stone;
   He glanced at Jenny, whose repose
      Seemed deeper than his own.
   With dumb dismay, on closer sight,
   He gathered sense that in the night,
      Or morn, her soul had flown.

   When told that some too mighty strain
      For one so many-yeared
   Had burst her bosom’s master-vein,
      His doubts remained unstirred.
   His Jenny had not left his side
   Betwixt the eve and morning-tide:
      —The King’s said not a word.

   Well! times are not as times were then,
      Nor fair ones half so free;
   And truly they were martial men,
      The King’s-Own Cavalry.
   And when they went from Casterbridge
   And vanished over Mellstock Ridge,
      ’Twas saddest morn to see.





THE CASTERBRIDGE CAPTAINS
(KHYBER PASS, 1842)


              A TRADITION OF J. B. L—, T. G. B—, AND J. L—.

   THREE captains went to Indian wars,
      And only one returned:
   Their mate of yore, he singly wore
      The laurels all had earned.

   At home he sought the ancient aisle
      Wherein, untrumped of fame,
   The three had sat in pupilage,
      And each had carved his name.

   The names, rough-hewn, of equal size,
      Stood on the panel still;
   Unequal since.—“’Twas theirs to aim,
      Mine was it to fulfil!”

   —“Who saves his life shall lose it, friends!”
      Outspake the preacher then,
   Unweeting he his listener, who
      Looked at the names again.

   That he had come and they’d been stayed,
      ’Twas but the chance of war:
   Another chance, and they’d sat here,
      And he had lain afar.

   Yet saw he something in the lives
      Of those who’d ceased to live
   That sphered them with a majesty
      Which living failed to give.

   Transcendent triumph in return
      No longer lit his brain;
   Transcendence rayed the distant urn
      Where slept the fallen twain.





A SIGN-SEEKER


   I MARK the months in liveries dank and dry,
      The noontides many-shaped and hued;
      I see the nightfall shades subtrude,
   And hear the monotonous hours clang negligently by.

   I view the evening bonfires of the sun
      On hills where morning rains have hissed;
      The eyeless countenance of the mist
   Pallidly rising when the summer droughts are done.

   I have seen the lightning-blade, the leaping star,
      The cauldrons of the sea in storm,
      Have felt the earthquake’s lifting arm,
   And trodden where abysmal fires and snow-cones are.

   I learn to prophesy the hid eclipse,
      The coming of eccentric orbs;
      To mete the dust the sky absorbs,
   To weigh the sun, and fix the hour each planet dips.

   I witness fellow earth-men surge and strive;
      Assemblies meet, and throb, and part;
      Death’s soothing finger, sorrow’s smart;
   —All the vast various moils that mean a world alive.

   But that I fain would wot of shuns my sense—
      Those sights of which old prophets tell,
      Those signs the general word so well,
   Vouchsafed to their unheed, denied my long suspense.

   In graveyard green, behind his monument
      To glimpse a phantom parent, friend,
      Wearing his smile, and “Not the end!”
   Outbreathing softly: that were blest enlightenment;

   Or, if a dead Love’s lips, whom dreams reveal
      When midnight imps of King Decay
      Delve sly to solve me back to clay,
   Should leave some print to prove her spirit-kisses real;

   Or, when Earth’s Frail lie bleeding of her Strong,
      If some Recorder, as in Writ,
      Near to the weary scene should flit
   And drop one plume as pledge that Heaven inscrolls the wrong.

   —There are who, rapt to heights of trancéd trust,
      These tokens claim to feel and see,
      Read radiant hints of times to be—
   Of heart to heart returning after dust to dust.

   Such scope is granted not to lives like mine . . .
      I have lain in dead men’s beds, have walked
      The tombs of those with whom I’d talked,
   Called many a gone and goodly one to shape a sign,

   And panted for response.  But none replies;
      No warnings loom, nor whisperings
      To open out my limitings,
   And Nescience mutely muses: When a man falls he lies.





MY CICELY
(17–)


   “ALIVE?”—And I leapt in my wonder,
      Was faint of my joyance,
   And grasses and grove shone in garments
      Of glory to me.

   “She lives, in a plenteous well-being,
      To-day as aforehand;
   The dead bore the name—though a rare one—
      The name that bore she.”

   She lived . . . I, afar in the city
      Of frenzy-led factions,
   Had squandered green years and maturer
      In bowing the knee

   To Baals illusive and specious,
      Till chance had there voiced me
   That one I loved vainly in nonage
      Had ceased her to be.

   The passion the planets had scowled on,
      And change had let dwindle,
   Her death-rumour smartly relifted
      To full apogee.

   I mounted a steed in the dawning
      With acheful remembrance,
   And made for the ancient West Highway
      To far Exonb’ry.

   Passing heaths, and the House of Long Sieging,
      I neared the thin steeple
   That tops the fair fane of Poore’s olden
      Episcopal see;

   And, changing anew my onbearer,
      I traversed the downland
   Whereon the bleak hill-graves of Chieftains
      Bulge barren of tree;

   And still sadly onward I followed
      That Highway the Icen,
   Which trails its pale riband down Wessex
      O’er lynchet and lea.

   Along through the Stour-bordered Forum,
      Where Legions had wayfared,
   And where the slow river upglasses
      Its green canopy,

   And by Weatherbury Castle, and thencefrom
      Through Casterbridge held I
   Still on, to entomb her my vision
      Saw stretched pallidly.

   No highwayman’s trot blew the night-wind
      To me so life-weary,
   But only the creak of the gibbets
      Or waggoners’ jee.

   Triple-ramparted Maidon gloomed grayly
      Above me from southward,
   And north the hill-fortress of Eggar,
      And square Pummerie.

   The Nine-Pillared Cromlech, the Bride-streams,
      The Axe, and the Otter
   I passed, to the gate of the city
      Where Exe scents the sea;

   Till, spent, in the graveacre pausing,
      I learnt ’twas not my Love
   To whom Mother Church had just murmured
      A last lullaby.

   —“Then, where dwells the Canon’s kinswoman,
      My friend of aforetime?”—
   (’Twas hard to repress my heart-heavings
      And new ecstasy.)

   “She wedded.”—“Ah!”—“Wedded beneath her—
      She keeps the stage-hostel
   Ten miles hence, beside the great Highway—
      The famed Lions-Three.

   “Her spouse was her lackey—no option
      ’Twixt wedlock and worse things;
   A lapse over-sad for a lady
      Of her pedigree!”

   I shuddered, said nothing, and wandered
      To shades of green laurel:
   Too ghastly had grown those first tidings
      So brightsome of blee!

   For, on my ride hither, I’d halted
      Awhile at the Lions,
   And her—her whose name had once opened
      My heart as a key—

   I’d looked on, unknowing, and witnessed
      Her jests with the tapsters,
   Her liquor-fired face, her thick accents
      In naming her fee.

   “O God, why this seeming derision!”
      I cried in my anguish:
   “O once Loved, O fair Unforgotten—
      That Thing—meant it thee!

   “Inurned and at peace, lost but sainted,
      Were grief I could compass;
   Depraved—’tis for Christ’s poor dependent
      A cruel decree!”

   I backed on the Highway; but passed not
      The hostel.  Within there
   Too mocking to Love’s re-expression
      Was Time’s repartee!

   Uptracking where Legions had wayfared,
      By cromlechs unstoried,
   And lynchets, and sepultured Chieftains,
      In self-colloquy,

   A feeling stirred in me and strengthened
      That _she_ was not my Love,
   But she of the garth, who lay rapt in
      Her long reverie.

   And thence till to-day I persuade me
      That this was the true one;
   That Death stole intact her young dearness
      And innocency.

   Frail-witted, illuded they call me;
      I may be.  ’Tis better
   To dream than to own the debasement
      Of sweet Cicely.

   Moreover I rate it unseemly
      To hold that kind Heaven
   Could work such device—to her ruin
      And my misery.

   So, lest I disturb my choice vision,
      I shun the West Highway,
   Even now, when the knaps ring with rhythms
      From blackbird and bee;

   And feel that with slumber half-conscious
      She rests in the church-hay,
   Her spirit unsoiled as in youth-time
      When lovers were we.





HER IMMORTALITY


   UPON a noon I pilgrimed through
      A pasture, mile by mile,
   Unto the place where I last saw
      My dead Love’s living smile.

   And sorrowing I lay me down
      Upon the heated sod:
   It seemed as if my body pressed
      The very ground she trod.

   I lay, and thought; and in a trance
      She came and stood me by—
   The same, even to the marvellous ray
      That used to light her eye.

   “You draw me, and I come to you,
      My faithful one,” she said,
   In voice that had the moving tone
      It bore ere breath had fled.

   She said: “’Tis seven years since I died:
      Few now remember me;
   My husband clasps another bride;
      My children’s love has she.

   “My brethren, sisters, and my friends
      Care not to meet my sprite:
   Who prized me most I did not know
      Till I passed down from sight.”

   I said: “My days are lonely here;
      I need thy smile alway:
   I’ll use this night my ball or blade,
      And join thee ere the day.”

   A tremor stirred her tender lips,
      Which parted to dissuade:
   “That cannot be, O friend,” she cried;
      “Think, I am but a Shade!

   “A Shade but in its mindful ones
      Has immortality;
   By living, me you keep alive,
      By dying you slay me.

   “In you resides my single power
      Of sweet continuance here;
   On your fidelity I count
      Through many a coming year.”

   —I started through me at her plight,
      So suddenly confessed:
   Dismissing late distaste for life,
      I craved its bleak unrest.

   “I will not die, my One of all!—
      To lengthen out thy days
   I’ll guard me from minutest harms
      That may invest my ways!”

   She smiled and went.  Since then she comes
      Oft when her birth-moon climbs,
   Or at the seasons’ ingresses
      Or anniversary times;

   But grows my grief.  When I surcease,
      Through whom alone lives she,
   Ceases my Love, her words, her ways,
      Never again to be!




THE IVY-WIFE


   I LONGED to love a full-boughed beech
      And be as high as he:
   I stretched an arm within his reach,
      And signalled unity.
   But with his drip he forced a breach,
      And tried to poison me.

   I gave the grasp of partnership
      To one of other race—
   A plane: he barked him strip by strip
      From upper bough to base;
   And me therewith; for gone my grip,
      My arms could not enlace.

   In new affection next I strove
      To coll an ash I saw,
   And he in trust received my love;
      Till with my soft green claw
   I cramped and bound him as I wove . . .
      Such was my love: ha-ha!

   By this I gained his strength and height
      Without his rivalry.
   But in my triumph I lost sight
      Of afterhaps.  Soon he,
   Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright,
      And in his fall felled me!




A MEETING WITH DESPAIR


   AS evening shaped I found me on a moor
      Which sight could scarce sustain:
   The black lean land, of featureless contour,
      Was like a tract in pain.

   “This scene, like my own life,” I said, “is one
      Where many glooms abide;
   Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun—
      Lightless on every side.

   I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught
      To see the contrast there:
   The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought,
      “There’s solace everywhere!”

   Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood
      I dealt me silently
   As one perverse—misrepresenting Good
      In graceless mutiny.

   Against the horizon’s dim-discernèd wheel
      A form rose, strange of mould:
   That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel
      Rather than could behold.

   “’Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent
      To darkness!” croaked the Thing.
   “Not if you look aloft!” said I, intent
      On my new reasoning.

   “Yea—but await awhile!” he cried.  “Ho-ho!—
      Look now aloft and see!”
   I looked.  There, too, sat night: Heaven’s radiant show
      Had gone.  Then chuckled he.




UNKNOWING


   WHEN, soul in soul reflected,
   We breathed an æthered air,
      When we neglected
      All things elsewhere,
   And left the friendly friendless
   To keep our love aglow,
      We deemed it endless . . .
      —We did not know!

   When, by mad passion goaded,
   We planned to hie away,
      But, unforeboded,
      The storm-shafts gray
   So heavily down-pattered
   That none could forthward go,
      Our lives seemed shattered . . .
      —We did not know!

   When I found you, helpless lying,
   And you waived my deep misprise,
      And swore me, dying,
      In phantom-guise
   To wing to me when grieving,
   And touch away my woe,
      We kissed, believing . . .
      —We did not know!

   But though, your powers outreckoning,
   You hold you dead and dumb,
      Or scorn my beckoning,
      And will not come;
   And I say, “’Twere mood ungainly
   To store her memory so:”
      I say it vainly—
      I feel and know!




FRIENDS BEYOND


   WILLIAM DEWY, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough,
      Robert’s kin, and John’s, and Ned’s,
   And the Squire, and Lady Susan, lie in Mellstock churchyard now!

   “Gone,” I call them, gone for good, that group of local hearts and
   heads;
      Yet at mothy curfew-tide,
   And at midnight when the noon-heat breathes it back from walls and
   leads,

   They’ve a way of whispering to me—fellow-wight who yet abide—
      In the muted, measured note
   Of a ripple under archways, or a lone cave’s stillicide:

   “We have triumphed: this achievement turns the bane to antidote,
      Unsuccesses to success,
   —Many thought-worn eves and morrows to a morrow free of thought.

   “No more need we corn and clothing, feel of old terrestrial stress;
      Chill detraction stirs no sigh;
   Fear of death has even bygone us: death gave all that we possess.”

   _W. D._—“Ye mid burn the wold bass-viol that I set such vallie by.”
      _Squire_.—“You may hold the manse in fee,
   You may wed my spouse, my children’s memory of me may decry.”

   _Lady_.—“You may have my rich brocades, my laces; take each household
   key;
      Ransack coffer, desk, bureau;
   Quiz the few poor treasures hid there, con the letters kept by me.”

   _Far._—“Ye mid zell my favourite heifer, ye mid let the charlock grow,
      Foul the grinterns, give up thrift.”
   _Wife_.—“If ye break my best blue china, children, I shan’t care or
   ho.”

   _All_. —“We’ve no wish to hear the tidings, how the people’s fortunes
   shift;
      What your daily doings are;
   Who are wedded, born, divided; if your lives beat slow or swift.

   “Curious not the least are we if our intents you make or mar,
      If you quire to our old tune,
   If the City stage still passes, if the weirs still roar afar.”

   —Thus, with very gods’ composure, freed those crosses late and soon
      Which, in life, the Trine allow
   (Why, none witteth), and ignoring all that haps beneath the moon,

   William Dewy, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough,
      Robert’s kin, and John’s, and Ned’s,
   And the Squire, and Lady Susan, murmur mildly to me now.





TO OUTER NATURE


   SHOW thee as I thought thee
   When I early sought thee,
      Omen-scouting,
      All undoubting
   Love alone had wrought thee—

   Wrought thee for my pleasure,
   Planned thee as a measure
      For expounding
      And resounding
   Glad things that men treasure.

   O for but a moment
   Of that old endowment—
      Light to gaily
      See thy daily
   Irisèd embowment!

   But such re-adorning
   Time forbids with scorning—
      Makes me see things
      Cease to be things
   They were in my morning.

   Fad’st thou, glow-forsaken,
   Darkness-overtaken!
      Thy first sweetness,
      Radiance, meetness,
   None shall re-awaken.

   Why not sempiternal
   Thou and I?  Our vernal
      Brightness keeping,
      Time outleaping;
   Passed the hodiernal!




THOUGHTS OF PHENA
AT NEWS OF HER DEATH


         NOT a line of her writing have I,
            Not a thread of her hair,
   No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
         I may picture her there;
      And in vain do I urge my unsight
         To conceive my lost prize
   At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light,
         And with laughter her eyes.

         What scenes spread around her last days,
            Sad, shining, or dim?
   Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways
         With an aureate nimb?
      Or did life-light decline from her years,
         And mischances control
   Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears
         Disennoble her soul?

         Thus I do but the phantom retain
            Of the maiden of yore
   As my relic; yet haply the best of her—fined in my brain
         It maybe the more
      That no line of her writing have I,
         Nor a thread of her hair,
   No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
         I may picture her there.

_March_ 1890.





MIDDLE-AGE ENTHUSIASMS
To M. H.


      WE passed where flag and flower
      Signalled a jocund throng;
      We said: “Go to, the hour
      Is apt!”—and joined the song;
   And, kindling, laughed at life and care,
   Although we knew no laugh lay there.

      We walked where shy birds stood
      Watching us, wonder-dumb;
      Their friendship met our mood;
      We cried: “We’ll often come:
   We’ll come morn, noon, eve, everywhen!”
   —We doubted we should come again.

      We joyed to see strange sheens
      Leap from quaint leaves in shade;
      A secret light of greens
      They’d for their pleasure made.
   We said: “We’ll set such sorts as these!”
   —We knew with night the wish would cease.

      “So sweet the place,” we said,
      “Its tacit tales so dear,
      Our thoughts, when breath has sped,
      Will meet and mingle here!” . . .
   “Words!” mused we.  “Passed the mortal door,
   Our thoughts will reach this nook no more.”




IN A WOOD
See “THE WOODLANDERS”


   PALE beech and pine-tree blue,
      Set in one clay,
   Bough to bough cannot you
      Bide out your day?
   When the rains skim and skip,
   Why mar sweet comradeship,
   Blighting with poison-drip
      Neighbourly spray?

   Heart-halt and spirit-lame,
      City-opprest,
   Unto this wood I came
      As to a nest;
   Dreaming that sylvan peace
   Offered the harrowed ease—
   Nature a soft release
      From men’s unrest.

   But, having entered in,
      Great growths and small
   Show them to men akin—
      Combatants all!
   Sycamore shoulders oak,
   Bines the slim sapling yoke,
   Ivy-spun halters choke
      Elms stout and tall.

   Touches from ash, O wych,
      Sting you like scorn!
   You, too, brave hollies, twitch
      Sidelong from thorn.
   Even the rank poplars bear
   Illy a rival’s air,
   Cankering in black despair
      If overborne.

   Since, then, no grace I find
      Taught me of trees,
   Turn I back to my kind,
      Worthy as these.
   There at least smiles abound,
   There discourse trills around,
   There, now and then, are found
      Life-loyalties.

1887: 1896.




TO A LADY
OFFENDED BY A BOOK OF THE WRITER’S


   NOW that my page upcloses, doomed, maybe,
   Never to press thy cosy cushions more,
   Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore,
   Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me:

   Knowing thy natural receptivity,
   I figure that, as flambeaux banish eve,
   My sombre image, warped by insidious heave
   Of those less forthright, must lose place in thee.

   So be it.  I have borne such.  Let thy dreams
   Of me and mine diminish day by day,
   And yield their space to shine of smugger things;
   Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams,
   And then in far and feeble visitings,
   And then surcease.  Truth will be truth alway.




TO AN ORPHAN CHILD
A WHIMSEY


   AH, child, thou art but half thy darling mother’s;
      Hers couldst thou wholly be,
   My light in thee would outglow all in others;
      She would relive to me.
   But niggard Nature’s trick of birth
      Bars, lest she overjoy,
   Renewal of the loved on earth
         Save with alloy.

   The Dame has no regard, alas, my maiden,
      For love and loss like mine—
   No sympathy with mind-sight memory-laden;
      Only with fickle eyne.
   To her mechanic artistry
      My dreams are all unknown,
   And why I wish that thou couldst be
         But One’s alone!





NATURE’S QUESTIONING


      WHEN I look forth at dawning, pool,
         Field, flock, and lonely tree,
         All seem to gaze at me
   Like chastened children sitting silent in a school;

      Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn,
         As though the master’s ways
         Through the long teaching days
   Their first terrestrial zest had chilled and overborne.

      And on them stirs, in lippings mere
         (As if once clear in call,
         But now scarce breathed at all)—
   “We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here!

      “Has some Vast Imbecility,
         Mighty to build and blend,
         But impotent to tend,
   Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry?

      “Or come we of an Automaton
         Unconscious of our pains? . . .
         Or are we live remains
   Of Godhead dying downwards, brain and eye now gone?

      “Or is it that some high Plan betides,
         As yet not understood,
         Of Evil stormed by Good,
   We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides?”

      Thus things around.  No answerer I . . .
         Meanwhile the winds, and rains,
         And Earth’s old glooms and pains
   Are still the same, and gladdest Life Death neighbours nigh.




THE IMPERCIPIENT
(AT A CATHEDRAL SERVICE)


   THAT from this bright believing band
      An outcast I should be,
   That faiths by which my comrades stand
      Seem fantasies to me,
   And mirage-mists their Shining Land,
      Is a drear destiny.

   Why thus my soul should be consigned
      To infelicity,
   Why always I must feel as blind
      To sights my brethren see,
   Why joys they’ve found I cannot find,
      Abides a mystery.

   Since heart of mine knows not that ease
      Which they know; since it be
   That He who breathes All’s Well to these
      Breathes no All’s-Well to me,
   My lack might move their sympathies
      And Christian charity!

   I am like a gazer who should mark
      An inland company
   Standing upfingered, with, “Hark! hark!
      The glorious distant sea!”
   And feel, “Alas, ’tis but yon dark
      And wind-swept pine to me!”

   Yet I would bear my shortcomings
      With meet tranquillity,
   But for the charge that blessed things
      I’d liefer have unbe.
   O, doth a bird deprived of wings
      Go earth-bound wilfully!

                                * * * * *

   Enough.  As yet disquiet clings
      About us.  Rest shall we.





AT AN INN


   WHEN we as strangers sought
      Their catering care,
   Veiled smiles bespoke their thought
      Of what we were.
   They warmed as they opined
      Us more than friends—
   That we had all resigned
      For love’s dear ends.

   And that swift sympathy
      With living love
   Which quicks the world—maybe
      The spheres above,
   Made them our ministers,
      Moved them to say,
   “Ah, God, that bliss like theirs
      Would flush our day!”

   And we were left alone
      As Love’s own pair;
   Yet never the love-light shone
      Between us there!
   But that which chilled the breath
      Of afternoon,
   And palsied unto death
      The pane-fly’s tune.

   The kiss their zeal foretold,
      And now deemed come,
   Came not: within his hold
      Love lingered-numb.
   Why cast he on our port
      A bloom not ours?
   Why shaped us for his sport
      In after-hours?

   As we seemed we were not
      That day afar,
   And now we seem not what
      We aching are.
   O severing sea and land,
      O laws of men,
   Ere death, once let us stand
      As we stood then!




THE SLOW NATURE
(AN INCIDENT OF FROOM VALLEY)


   “THY husband—poor, poor Heart!—is dead—
      Dead, out by Moreford Rise;
   A bull escaped the barton-shed,
      Gored him, and there he lies!”

   —“Ha, ha—go away!  ’Tis a tale, methink,
      Thou joker Kit!” laughed she.
   “I’ve known thee many a year, Kit Twink,
      And ever hast thou fooled me!”

   —“But, Mistress Damon—I can swear
      Thy goodman John is dead!
   And soon th’lt hear their feet who bear
      His body to his bed.”

   So unwontedly sad was the merry man’s face—
      That face which had long deceived—
   That she gazed and gazed; and then could trace
      The truth there; and she believed.

   She laid a hand on the dresser-ledge,
      And scanned far Egdon-side;
   And stood; and you heard the wind-swept sedge
      And the rippling Froom; till she cried:

   “O my chamber’s untidied, unmade my bed
      Though the day has begun to wear!
   ‘What a slovenly hussif!’ it will be said,
      When they all go up my stair!”

   She disappeared; and the joker stood
      Depressed by his neighbour’s doom,
   And amazed that a wife struck to widowhood
      Thought first of her unkempt room.

   But a fortnight thence she could take no food,
      And she pined in a slow decay;
   While Kit soon lost his mournful mood
      And laughed in his ancient way.

1894.




IN A EWELEAZE NEAR WEATHERBURY


   THE years have gathered grayly
      Since I danced upon this leaze
   With one who kindled gaily
      Love’s fitful ecstasies!
   But despite the term as teacher,
      I remain what I was then
   In each essential feature
      Of the fantasies of men.

   Yet I note the little chisel
      Of never-napping Time,
   Defacing ghast and grizzel
      The blazon of my prime.
   When at night he thinks me sleeping,
      I feel him boring sly
   Within my bones, and heaping
      Quaintest pains for by-and-by.

   Still, I’d go the world with Beauty,
      I would laugh with her and sing,
   I would shun divinest duty
      To resume her worshipping.
   But she’d scorn my brave endeavour,
      She would not balm the breeze
   By murmuring “Thine for ever!”
      As she did upon this leaze.

1890.





ADDITIONS


THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY’S


   THEY had long met o’ Zundays—her true love and she—
      And at junketings, maypoles, and flings;
   But she bode wi’ a thirtover uncle, and he
   Swore by noon and by night that her goodman should be
   Naibour Sweatley—a gaffer oft weak at the knee
   From taking o’ sommat more cheerful than tea—
      Who tranted, and moved people’s things.

   She cried, “O pray pity me!”  Nought would he hear;
      Then with wild rainy eyes she obeyed.
   She chid when her Love was for clinking off wi’ her.
   The pa’son was told, as the season drew near
   To throw over pu’pit the names of the peäir
      As fitting one flesh to be made.

   The wedding-day dawned and the morning drew on;
      The couple stood bridegroom and bride;
   The evening was passed, and when midnight had gone
   The folks horned out, “God save the King,” and anon
      The two home-along gloomily hied.

   The lover Tim Tankens mourned heart-sick and drear
      To be thus of his darling deprived:
   He roamed in the dark ath’art field, mound, and mere,
   And, a’most without knowing it, found himself near
   The house of the tranter, and now of his Dear,
      Where the lantern-light showed ’em arrived.

   The bride sought her cham’er so calm and so pale
      That a Northern had thought her resigned;
   But to eyes that had seen her in tide-times of weal,
   Like the white cloud o’ smoke, the red battle-field’s vail,
      That look spak’ of havoc behind.

   The bridegroom yet laitered a beaker to drain,
      Then reeled to the linhay for more,
   When the candle-snoff kindled some chaff from his grain—
   Flames spread, and red vlankers, wi’ might and wi’ main,
      And round beams, thatch, and chimley-tun roar.

   Young Tim away yond, rafted up by the light,
      Through brimble and underwood tears,
   Till he comes to the orchet, when crooping thereright
   In the lewth of a codlin-tree, bivering wi’ fright,
   Wi’ on’y her night-rail to screen her from sight,
      His lonesome young Barbree appears.

   Her cwold little figure half-naked he views
      Played about by the frolicsome breeze,
   Her light-tripping totties, her ten little tooes,
   All bare and besprinkled wi’ Fall’s chilly dews,
   While her great gallied eyes, through her hair hanging loose,
      Sheened as stars through a tardle o’ trees.

   She eyed en; and, as when a weir-hatch is drawn,
      Her tears, penned by terror afore,
   With a rushing of sobs in a shower were strawn,
   Till her power to pour ’em seemed wasted and gone
      From the heft o’ misfortune she bore.

   “O Tim, my _own_ Tim I must call ’ee—I will!
      All the world ha’ turned round on me so!
   Can you help her who loved ’ee, though acting so ill?
   Can you pity her misery—feel for her still?
   When worse than her body so quivering and chill
      Is her heart in its winter o’ woe!

   “I think I mid almost ha’ borne it,” she said,
      “Had my griefs one by one come to hand;
   But O, to be slave to thik husbird for bread,
   And then, upon top o’ that, driven to wed,
   And then, upon top o’ that, burnt out o’ bed,
      Is more than my nater can stand!”

   Tim’s soul like a lion ’ithin en outsprung—
   (Tim had a great soul when his feelings were wrung)—
      “Feel for ’ee, dear Barbree?” he cried;
   And his warm working-jacket about her he flung,
   Made a back, horsed her up, till behind him she clung
   Like a chiel on a gipsy, her figure uphung
      By the sleeves that around her he tied.

   Over piggeries, and mixens, and apples, and hay,
      They lumpered straight into the night;
   And finding bylong where a halter-path lay,
   At dawn reached Tim’s house, on’y seen on their way
   By a naibour or two who were up wi’ the day;
      But they gathered no clue to the sight.

   Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and there
      For some garment to clothe her fair skin;
   But though he had breeches and waistcoats to spare,
   He had nothing quite seemly for Barbree to wear,
   Who, half shrammed to death, stood and cried on a chair
      At the caddle she found herself in.

   There was one thing to do, and that one thing he did,
      He lent her some clouts of his own,
   And she took ’em perforce; and while in ’em she slid,
   Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid,
   Thinking, “O that the picter my duty keeps hid
      To the sight o’ my eyes mid be shown!”

   In the tallet he stowed her; there huddied she lay,
      Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs;
   But most o’ the time in a mortal bad way,
   Well knowing that there’d be the divel to pay
   If ’twere found that, instead o’ the elements’ prey,
      She was living in lodgings at Tim’s.

   “Where’s the tranter?” said men and boys; “where can er be?”
      “Where’s the tranter?” said Barbree alone.
   “Where on e’th is the tranter?” said everybod-y:
   They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree,
      And all they could find was a bone.

   Then the uncle cried, “Lord, pray have mercy on me!”
      And in terror began to repent.
   But before ’twas complete, and till sure she was free,
   Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key—
   Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea—
      Till the news of her hiding got vent.

   Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and flare
   Of a skimmington-ride through the naibourhood, ere
      Folk had proof o’ wold Sweatley’s decay.
   Whereupon decent people all stood in a stare,
   Saying Tim and his lodger should risk it, and pair:
   So he took her to church.  An’ some laughing lads there
   Cried to Tim, “After Sweatley!”  She said, “I declare
      I stand as a maiden to-day!”

HEIRESS AND ARCHITECT
FOR A. W. B.


   SHE sought the Studios, beckoning to her side
   An arch-designer, for she planned to build.
   He was of wise contrivance, deeply skilled
   In every intervolve of high and wide—
      Well fit to be her guide.

         “Whatever it be,”
         Responded he,
   With cold, clear voice, and cold, clear view,
   “In true accord with prudent fashionings
   For such vicissitudes as living brings,
   And thwarting not the law of stable things,
      That will I do.”

   “Shape me,” she said, “high halls with tracery
   And open ogive-work, that scent and hue
   Of buds, and travelling bees, may come in through,
   The note of birds, and singings of the sea,
      For these are much to me.”

      “An idle whim!”
      Broke forth from him
   Whom nought could warm to gallantries:
   “Cede all these buds and birds, the zephyr’s call,
   And scents, and hues, and things that falter all,
   And choose as best the close and surly wall,
      For winters freeze.”

   “Then frame,” she cried, “wide fronts of crystal glass,
   That I may show my laughter and my light—
   Light like the sun’s by day, the stars’ by night—
   Till rival heart-queens, envying, wail, ‘Alas,
      Her glory!’ as they pass.”

      “O maid misled!”
      He sternly said,
   Whose facile foresight pierced her dire;
   “Where shall abide the soul when, sick of glee,
   It shrinks, and hides, and prays no eye may see?
   Those house them best who house for secrecy,
      For you will tire.”

   “A little chamber, then, with swan and dove
   Ranged thickly, and engrailed with rare device
   Of reds and purples, for a Paradise
   Wherein my Love may greet me, I my Love,
      When he shall know thereof?”

      “This, too, is ill,”
      He answered still,
   The man who swayed her like a shade.
   “An hour will come when sight of such sweet nook
   Would bring a bitterness too sharp to brook,
   When brighter eyes have won away his look;
      For you will fade.”

   Then said she faintly: “O, contrive some way—
   Some narrow winding turret, quite mine own,
   To reach a loft where I may grieve alone!
   It is a slight thing; hence do not, I pray,
      This last dear fancy slay!”

      “Such winding ways
      Fit not your days,”
   Said he, the man of measuring eye;
   “I must even fashion as my rule declares,
   To wit: Give space (since life ends unawares)
   To hale a coffined corpse adown the stairs;
      For you will die.”

1867.



THE TWO MEN


   THERE were two youths of equal age,
   Wit, station, strength, and parentage;
   They studied at the selfsame schools,
   And shaped their thoughts by common rules.

   One pondered on the life of man,
   His hopes, his ending, and began
   To rate the Market’s sordid war
   As something scarce worth living for.

   “I’ll brace to higher aims,” said he,
   “I’ll further Truth and Purity;
   Thereby to mend the mortal lot
   And sweeten sorrow.  Thrive I not,

   “Winning their hearts, my kind will give
   Enough that I may lowly live,
   And house my Love in some dim dell,
   For pleasing them and theirs so well.”

   Idly attired, with features wan,
   In secret swift he laboured on:
   Such press of power had brought much gold
   Applied to things of meaner mould.

   Sometimes he wished his aims had been
   To gather gains like other men;
   Then thanked his God he’d traced his track
   Too far for wish to drag him back.

   He lookèd from his loft one day
   To where his slighted garden lay;
   Nettles and hemlock hid each lawn,
   And every flower was starved and gone.

   He fainted in his heart, whereon
   He rose, and sought his plighted one,
   Resolved to loose her bond withal,
   Lest she should perish in his fall.

   He met her with a careless air,
   As though he’d ceased to find her fair,
   And said: “True love is dust to me;
   I cannot kiss: I tire of thee!”

   (That she might scorn him was he fain,
   To put her sooner out of pain;
   For incensed love breathes quick and dies,
   When famished love a-lingering lies.)

   Once done, his soul was so betossed,
   It found no more the force it lost:
   Hope was his only drink and food,
   And hope extinct, decay ensued.

   And, living long so closely penned,
   He had not kept a single friend;
   He dwindled thin as phantoms be,
   And drooped to death in poverty . . .

   Meantime his schoolmate had gone out
   To join the fortune-finding rout;
   He liked the winnings of the mart,
   But wearied of the working part.

   He turned to seek a privy lair,
   Neglecting note of garb and hair,
   And day by day reclined and thought
   How he might live by doing nought.

   “I plan a valued scheme,” he said
   To some.  “But lend me of your bread,
   And when the vast result looms nigh,
   In profit you shall stand as I.”

   Yet they took counsel to restrain
   Their kindness till they saw the gain;
   And, since his substance now had run,
   He rose to do what might be done.

   He went unto his Love by night,
   And said: “My Love, I faint in fight:
   Deserving as thou dost a crown,
   My cares shall never drag thee down.”

   (He had descried a maid whose line
   Would hand her on much corn and wine,
   And held her far in worth above
   One who could only pray and love.)

   But this Fair read him; whence he failed
   To do the deed so blithely hailed;
   He saw his projects wholly marred,
   And gloom and want oppressed him hard;

   Till, living to so mean an end,
   Whereby he’d lost his every friend,
   He perished in a pauper sty,
   His mate the dying pauper nigh.

   And moralists, reflecting, said,
   As “dust to dust” in burial read
   Was echoed from each coffin-lid,
   “These men were like in all they did.”

LINES


_Spoken by Miss_ ADA REHAN _at the Lyceum Theatre_, _July_ 23, 1890, _at
a performance on behalf of Lady Jeune’s Holiday Fund for City Children_.

   BEFORE we part to alien thoughts and aims,
   Permit the one brief word the occasion claims:
   —When mumming and grave projects are allied,
   Perhaps an Epilogue is justified.

   Our under-purpose has, in truth, to-day
   Commanded most our musings; least the play:
   A purpose futile but for your good-will
   Swiftly responsive to the cry of ill:
   A purpose all too limited!—to aid
   Frail human flowerets, sicklied by the shade,
   In winning some short spell of upland breeze,
   Or strengthening sunlight on the level leas.

   Who has not marked, where the full cheek should be,
   Incipient lines of lank flaccidity,
   Lymphatic pallor where the pink should glow,
   And where the throb of transport, pulses low?—
   Most tragical of shapes from Pole to Line,
   O wondering child, unwitting Time’s design,
   Why should Art add to Nature’s quandary,
   And worsen ill by thus immuring thee?
   —That races do despite unto their own,
   That Might supernal do indeed condone
   Wrongs individual for the general ease,
   Instance the proof in victims such as these.

   Launched into thoroughfares too thronged before,
   Mothered by those whose protest is “No more!”
   Vitalized without option: who shall say
   That did Life hang on choosing—Yea or Nay—
   They had not scorned it with such penalty,
   And nothingness implored of Destiny?

   And yet behind the horizon smile serene
   The down, the cornland, and the stretching green—
   Space—the child’s heaven: scenes which at least ensure
   Some palliative for ill they cannot cure.

   Dear friends—now moved by this poor show of ours
   To make your own long joy in buds and bowers
   For one brief while the joy of infant eyes,
   Changing their urban murk to paradise—
   You have our thanks!—may your reward include
   More than our thanks, far more: their gratitude.



“I LOOK INTO MY GLASS”


   I LOOK into my glass,
   And view my wasting skin,
   And say, “Would God it came to pass
   My heart had shrunk as thin!”

   For then, I, undistrest
   By hearts grown cold to me,
   Could lonely wait my endless rest
   With equanimity.

   But Time, to make me grieve;
   Part steals, lets part abide;
   And shakes this fragile frame at eve
   With throbbings of noontide.
