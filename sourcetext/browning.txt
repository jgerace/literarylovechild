A LAMENT FOR ADONIS


FROM THE GREEK OF BION


  I.

  I mourn for Adonis--Adonis is dead,
    Fair Adonis is dead and the Loves are lamenting.
  Sleep, Cypris, no more on thy purple-strewed bed:
    Arise, wretch stoled in black; beat thy breast unrelenting,
  And shriek to the worlds, "Fair Adonis is dead!"


  II.

  I mourn for Adonis--the Loves are lamenting.
    He lies on the hills in his beauty and death;
  The white tusk of a boar has transpierced his white thigh.
    Cytherea grows mad at his thin gasping breath,
  While the black blood drips down on the pale ivory,
    And his eyeballs lie quenched with the weight of his brows,
  The rose fades from his lips, and upon them just parted
    The kiss dies the goddess consents not to lose,
  Though the kiss of the Dead cannot make her glad-hearted:
    He knows not who kisses him dead in the dews.


  III.

  I mourn for Adonis--the Loves are lamenting.
    Deep, deep in the thigh is Adonis's wound,
  But a deeper, is Cypris's bosom presenting.
    The youth lieth dead while his dogs howl around,
  And the nymphs weep aloud from the mists of the hill,
    And the poor Aphrodité, with tresses unbound,
  All dishevelled, unsandaled, shrieks mournful and shrill
    Through the dusk of the groves. The thorns, tearing her feet,
  Gather up the red flower of her blood which is holy,
    Each footstep she takes; and the valleys repeat
  The sharp cry she utters and draw it out slowly.
    She calls on her spouse, her Assyrian, on him
  Her own youth, while the dark blood spreads over his body,
    The chest taking hue from the gash in the limb,
  And the bosom, once ivory, turning to ruddy.


  IV.

  Ah, ah, Cytherea! the Loves are lamenting.
    She lost her fair spouse and so lost her fair smile:
  When he lived she was fair, by the whole world's consenting,
    Whose fairness is dead with him: woe worth the while!
  All the mountains above and the oaklands below
    Murmur, ah, ah, Adonis! the streams overflow
  Aphrodité's deep wail; river-fountains in pity
    Weep soft in the hills, and the flowers as they blow
  Redden outward with sorrow, while all hear her go
    With the song of her sadness through mountain and city.


  V.

  Ah, ah, Cytherea! Adonis is dead,
    Fair Adonis is dead--Echo answers, Adonis:
  Who weeps not for Cypris, when bowing her head
    She stares at the wound where it gapes and astonies?
  --When, ah, ah!--she saw how the blood ran away
    And empurpled the thigh, and, with wild hands flung out,
  Said with sobs: "Stay, Adonis! unhappy one, stay,
    Let me feel thee once more, let me ring thee about
  With the clasp of my arms, and press kiss into kiss!
    Wait a little, Adonis, and kiss me again,
  For the last time, beloved,--and but so much of this
    That the kiss may learn life from the warmth of the strain!
  --Till thy breath shall exude from thy soul to my mouth,
    To my heart, and, the love-charm I once more receiving
  May drink thy love in it and keep of a truth
    That one kiss in the place of Adonis the living.
  Thou fliest me, mournful one, fliest me far,
    My Adonis, and seekest the Acheron portal,--
  To Hell's cruel King goest down with a scar,
    While I weep and live on like a wretched immortal,
  And follow no step! O Persephoné, take him,
    My husband!--thou'rt better and brighter than I,
  So all beauty flows down to thee: I cannot make him
    Look up at my grief; there's despair in my cry,
  Since I wail for Adonis who died to me--died to me--
    Then, I fear thee!--Art thou dead, my Adored?
  Passion ends like a dream in the sleep that's denied to me,
    Cypris is widowed, the Loves seek their lord
  All the house through in vain. Charm of cestus has ceased
    With thy clasp! O too bold in the hunt past preventing,
  Ay, mad, thou so fair, to have strife with a beast!"
    Thus the goddess wailed on--and the Loves are lamenting.


  VI.

  Ah, ah, Cytherea! Adonis is dead.
  She wept tear after tear with the blood which was shed,
  And both turned into flowers for the earth's garden-close,
  Her tears, to the windflower; his blood, to the rose.


  VII.

  I mourn for Adonis--Adonis is dead.
    Weep no more in the woods, Cytherea, thy lover!
  So, well: make a place for his corse in thy bed,
    With the purples thou sleepest in, under and over
  He's fair though a corse--a fair corse, like a sleeper.
    Lay him soft in the silks he had pleasure to fold
  When, beside thee at night, holy dreams deep and deeper
    Enclosed his young life on the couch made of gold.
  Love him still, poor Adonis; cast on him together
    The crowns and the flowers: since he died from the place,
  Why, let all die with him; let the blossoms go wither,
    Rain myrtles and olive-buds down on his face.
  Rain the myrrh down, let all that is best fall a-pining,
    Since the myrrh of his life from thy keeping is swept.
  Pale he lay, thine Adonis, in purples reclining,
    The Loves raised their voices around him and wept.
  They have shorn their bright curls off to cast on Adonis;
  One treads on his bow,--on his arrows, another,--
  One breaks up a well-feathered quiver, and one is
    Bent low at a sandal, untying the strings,
    And one carries the vases of gold from the springs,
  While one washes the wound,--and behind them a brother
    Fans down on the body sweet air with his wings.


  VIII.

  Cytherea herself now the Loves are lamenting
    Each torch at the door Hymenæus blew out;
  And, the marriage-wreath dropping its leaves as repenting,
    No more "Hymen, Hymen," is chanted about,
  But the ai ai instead--"Ai alas!" is begun
    For Adonis, and then follows "Ai Hymenæus!"
  The Graces are weeping for Cinyris' son,
    Sobbing low each to each, "His fair eyes cannot see us!"
  Their wail strikes more shrill than the sadder Dioné's.
  The Fates mourn aloud for Adonis, Adonis,
  Deep chanting; he hears not a word that they say:
    He would hear, but Persephoné has him in keeping.
  --Cease moan, Cytherea! leave pomps for to-day,
    And weep new when a new year refits thee for weeping.




A VISION OF POETS


    O Sacred Essence, lighting me this hour,
    How may I lightly stile thy great power?
  Echo.                              Power.
    Power! but of whence? under the greenwood spraye?
    Or liv'st in Heaven? saye.
  Echo.                      In Heavens aye.
    In Heavens aye! tell, may I it obtayne
    By alms, by fasting, prayer,--by paine?
  Echo.                            By paine
    Show me the paine, it shall be undergone.
    I to mine end will still go on.
  Echo.                           Go on.

A VISION OF POETS.


  A poet could not sleep aright,
  For his soul kept up too much light
  Under his eyelids for the night.

  And thus he rose disquieted
  With sweet rhymes ringing through his head,
  And in the forest wanderèd

  Where, sloping up the darkest glades,
  The moon had drawn long colonnades
  Upon whose floor the verdure fades

  To a faint silver: pavement fair,
  The antique wood-nymphs scarce would dare
  To foot-print o'er, had such been there,

  And rather sit by breathlessly,
  With fear in their large eyes, to see
  The consecrated sight. But HE--

  The poet who, with spirit-kiss
  Familiar, had long claimed for his
  Whatever earthly beauty is,

  Who also in his spirit bore
  A beauty passing the earth's store,--
  Walked calmly onward evermore.

  His aimless thoughts in metre went,
  Like a babe's hand without intent
  Drawn down a seven-stringed instrument:

  Nor jarred it with his humour as,
  With a faint stirring of the grass,
  An apparition fair did pass.

  He might have feared another time,
  But all things fair and strange did chime
  With his thoughts then, as rhyme to rhyme.

  An angel had not startled him,
  Alighted from heaven's burning rim
  To breathe from glory in the Dim;

  Much less a lady riding slow
  Upon a palfrey white as snow,
  And smooth as a snow-cloud could go.

  Full upon his she turned her face,
  "What ho, sir poet! dost thou pace
  Our woods at night in ghostly chase

  "Of some fair Dryad of old tales
  Who chants between the nightingales
  And over sleep by song prevails?"

  She smiled; but he could see arise
  Her soul from far adown her eyes,
  Prepared as if for sacrifice.

  She looked a queen who seemeth gay
  From royal grace alone. "Now, nay,"
  He answered, "slumber passed away,

  "Compelled by instincts in my head
  That I should see to-night, instead
  Of a fair nymph, some fairer Dread."

  She looked up quickly to the sky
  And spake: "The moon's regality
  Will hear no praise; She is as I.

  "She is in heaven, and I on earth;
  This is my kingdom: I come forth
  To crown all poets to their worth."

  He brake in with a voice that mourned;
  "To their worth, lady? They are scorned
  By men they sing for, till inurned.

  "To their worth? Beauty in the mind
  Leaves the hearth cold, and love-refined
  Ambitions make the world unkind.

  "The boor who ploughs the daisy down,
  The chief whose mortgage of renown,
  Fixed upon graves, has bought a crown--

  "Both these are happier, more approved
  Than poets!--why should I be moved
  In saying, both are more beloved?"

  "The south can judge not of the north,"
  She resumed calmly; "I come forth
  To crown all poets to their worth.

  "Yea, verily, to anoint them all
  With blessed oils which surely shall
  Smell sweeter as the ages fall."

  "As sweet," the poet said, and rung
  A low sad laugh, "as flowers are, sprung
  Out of their graves when they die young;

  "As sweet as window-eglantine,
  Some bough of which, as they decline,
  The hired nurse gathers at their sign:

  "As sweet, in short, as perfumed shroud
  Which the gay Roman maidens sewed
  For English Keats, singing aloud."

  The lady answered, "Yea, as sweet!
  The things thou namest being complete
  In fragrance, as I measure it.

  "Since sweet the death-clothes and the knell
  Of him who having lived, dies well;
  And wholly sweet the asphodel

  "Stirred softly by that foot of his,
  When he treads brave on all that is,
  Into the world of souls, from this.

  "Since sweet the tears, dropped at the door
  Of tearless Death, and even before:
  Sweet, consecrated evermore.

  "What, dost thou judge it a strange thing
  That poets, crowned for vanquishing,
  Should bear some dust from out the ring?

  "Come on with me, come on with me,
  And learn in coming: let me free
  Thy spirit into verity."

  She ceased: her palfrey's paces sent
  No separate noises as she went;
  'Twas a bee's hum, a little spent.

  And while the poet seemed to tread
  Along the drowsy noise so made,
  The forest heaved up overhead

  Its billowy foliage through the air,
  And the calm stars did far and spare
  O'erswim the masses everywhere

  Save when the overtopping pines
  Did bar their tremulous light with lines
  All fixed and black. Now the moon shines

  A broader glory. You may see
  The trees grow rarer presently;
  The air blows up more fresh and free:

  Until they come from dark to light,
  And from the forest to the sight
  Of the large heaven-heart, bare with night,

  A fiery throb in every star,
  Those burning arteries that are
  The conduits of God's life afar,--

  A wild brown moorland underneath,
  And four pools breaking up the heath
  With white low gleamings, blank as death.

  Beside the first pool, near the wood,
  A dead tree in set horror stood,
  Peeled and disjointed, stark as rood;

  Since thunder-stricken, years ago,
  Fixed in the spectral strain and throe
  Wherewith it struggled from the blow:

  A monumental tree, alone,
  That will not bend in storms, nor groan,
  But break off sudden like a stone.

  Its lifeless shadow lies oblique
  Upon the pool where, javelin-like,
  The star-rays quiver while they strike.

  "Drink," said the lady, very still--
  "Be holy and cold." He did her will
  And drank the starry water chill.

  The next pool they came near unto
  Was bare of trees; there, only grew
  Straight flags, and lilies just a few

  Which sullen on the water sate
  And leant their faces on the flat,
  As weary of the starlight-state.

  "Drink," said the lady, grave and slow--
  "World's use behoveth thee to know."
  He drank the bitter wave below.

  The third pool, girt with thorny bushes
  And flaunting weeds and reeds and rushes
  That winds sang through in mournful gushes,

  Was whitely smeared in many a round
  By a slow slime; the starlight swound
  Over the ghastly light it found.

  "Drink," said the lady, sad and slow--
  "World's love behoveth thee to know."
  He looked to her commanding so;

  Her brow was troubled, but her eye
  Struck clear to his soul. For all reply
  He drank the water suddenly,--

  Then, with a deathly sickness, passed
  Beside the fourth pool and the last,
  Where weights of shadow were downcast

  From yew and alder and rank trails
  Of nightshade clasping the trunk-scales
  And flung across the intervals

  From yew to yew: who dares to stoop
  Where those dank branches overdroop,
  Into his heart the chill strikes up,

  He hears a silent gliding coil,
  The snakes strain hard against the soil,
  His foot slips in their slimy oil,

  And toads seem crawling on his hand,
  And clinging bats but dimly scanned
  Full in his face their wings expand.

  A paleness took the poet's cheek:
  "Must I drink here?" he seemed to seek
  The lady's will with utterance meek:

  "Ay, ay," she said, "it so must be;"
  (And this time she spake cheerfully)
  "Behoves thee know World's cruelty."

  He bowed his forehead till his mouth
  Curved in the wave, and drank unloth
  As if from rivers of the south;

  His lips sobbed through the water rank,
  His heart paused in him while he drank,
  His brain beat heart-like, rose and sank,

  And he swooned backward to a dream
  Wherein he lay 'twixt gloom and gleam,
  With Death and Life at each extreme:

  And spiritual thunders, born of soul
  Not cloud, did leap from mystic pole
  And o'er him roll and counter-roll,

  Crushing their echoes reboant
  With their own wheels. Did Heaven so grant
  His spirit a sign of covenant?

  At last came silence. A slow kiss
  Did crown his forehead after this;
  His eyelids flew back for the bliss--

  The lady stood beside his head,
  Smiling a thought, with hair dispread;
  The moonshine seemed dishevellèd

  In her sleek tresses manifold
  Like Danaë's in the rain of old
  That dripped with melancholy gold:

  But SHE was holy, pale and high
  As one who saw an ecstasy
  Beyond a foretold agony.

  "Rise up!" said she with voice where song
  Eddied through speech, "rise up; be strong:
  And learn how right avenges wrong."

  The poet rose up on his feet:
  He stood before an altar set
  For sacrament with vessels meet

  And mystic altar-lights which shine
  As if their flames were crystalline
  Carved flames that would not shrink or pine.

  The altar filled the central place
  Of a great church, and toward its face
  Long aisles did shoot and interlace,

  And from it a continuous mist
  Of incense (round the edges kissed
  By a yellow light of amethyst)

  Wound upward slowly and throbbingly,
  Cloud within cloud, right silverly,
  Cloud above cloud, victoriously,--

  Broke full against the archèd roof
  And thence refracting eddied off
  And floated through the marble woof

  Of many a fine-wrought architrave,
  Then, poising its white masses brave,
  Swept solemnly down aisle and nave

  Where, now in dark and now in light,
  The countless columns, glimmering white,
  Seemed leading out to the Infinite:

  Plunged halfway up the shaft, they showed
  In that pale shifting incense-cloud
  Which flowed them by and overflowed

  Till mist and marble seemed to blend
  And the whole temple, at the end,
  With its own incense to distend,--

  The arches like a giant's bow
  To bend and slacken,--and below,
  The nichèd saints to come and go:

  Alone amid the shifting scene
  That central altar stood serene
  In its clear steadfast taper-sheen.

  Then first, the poet was aware
  Of a chief angel standing there
  Before that altar, in the glare.

  His eyes were dreadful, for you saw
  That they saw God; his lips and jaw
  Grand-made and strong, as Sinai's law

  They could enunciate and refrain
  From vibratory after-pain,
  And his brow's height was sovereign:

  On the vast background of his wings
  Rises his image, and he flings
  From each plumed arc pale glitterings

  And fiery flakes (as beateth, more
  Or less, the angel-heart) before
  And round him upon roof and floor,

  Edging with fire the shifting fumes,
  While at his side 'twixt lights and glooms
  The phantasm of an organ booms.

  Extending from which instrument
  And angel, right and left-way bent,
  The poet's sight grew sentient

  Of a strange company around
  And toward the altar, pale and bound
  With bay above the eyes profound.

  Deathful their faces were, and yet
  The power of life was in them set--
  Never forgot nor to forget:

  Sublime significance of mouth,
  Dilated nostril full of youth,
  And forehead royal with the truth.

  These faces were not multiplied
  Beyond your count, but side by side
  Did front the altar, glorified,

  Still as a vision, yet exprest
  Full as an action--look and geste
  Of buried saint in risen rest.

  The poet knew them. Faint and dim
  His spirits seemed to sink in him--
  Then, like a dolphin, change and swim

  The current: these were poets true,
  Who died for Beauty as martyrs do
  For Truth--the ends being scarcely two.

  God's prophets of the Beautiful
  These poets were; of iron rule,
  The rugged cilix, serge of wool.

  Here Homer, with the broad suspense
  Of thunderous brows, and lips intense
  Of garrulous god-innocence.

  There Shakespeare, on whose forehead climb
  The crowns o' the world: O eyes sublime
  With tears and laughters for all time!

  Here Æschylus, the women swooned
  To see so awful when he frowned
  As the gods did: he standeth crowned.

  Euripides, with close and mild
  Scholastic lips, that could be wild
  And laugh or sob out like a child

  Even in the classes. Sophocles,
  With that king's-look which down the trees
  Followed the dark effigies

  Of the lost Theban. Hesiod old,
  Who, somewhat blind and deaf and cold,
  Cared most for gods and bulls. And bold

  Electric Pindar, quick as fear,
  With race-dust on his cheeks, and clear
  Slant startled eyes that seem to hear

  The chariot rounding the last goal,
  To hurtle past it in his soul.
  And Sappho, with that gloriole

  Of ebon hair on calmèd brows--
  O poet-woman! none forgoes
  The leap, attaining the repose.

  Theocritus, with glittering locks
  Dropt sideway, as betwixt the rocks
  He watched the visionary flocks.

  And Aristophanes, who took
  The world with mirth, and laughter-struck
  The hollow caves of Thought and woke

  The infinite echoes hid in each.
  And Virgil: shade of Mantuan beech
  Did help the shade of bay to reach

  And knit around his forehead high:
  For his gods wore less majesty
  Than his brown bees hummed deathlessly.

  Lucretius, nobler than his mood,
  Who dropped his plummet down the broad
  Deep universe and said "No God--"

  Finding no bottom: he denied
  Divinely the divine, and died
  Chief poet on the Tiber-side

  By grace of God: his face is stern
  As one compelled, in spite of scorn,
  To teach a truth he would not learn.

  And Ossian, dimly seen or guessed;
  Once counted greater than the rest,
  When mountain-winds blew out his vest.

  And Spenser drooped his dreaming head
  (With languid sleep-smile you had said
  From his own verse engenderèd)

  On Ariosto's, till they ran
  Their curls in one: the Italian
  Shot nimbler heat of bolder man

  From his fine lids. And Dante stern
  And sweet, whose spirit was an urn
  For wine and milk poured out in turn.

  Hard-souled Alfieri; and fancy-willed
  Boiardo, who with laughter filled
  The pauses of the jostled shield.

  And Berni, with a hand stretched out
  To sleek that storm. And, not without
  The wreath he died in and the doubt

  He died by, Tasso, bard and lover,
  Whose visions were too thin to cover
  The face of a false woman over.

  And soft Racine; and grave Corneille,
  The orator of rhymes, whose wail
  Scarce shook his purple. And Petrarch pale,

  From whose brain-lighted heart were thrown
  A thousand thoughts beneath the sun,
  Each lucid with the name of One.

  And Camoens, with that look he had,
  Compelling India's Genius sad
  From the wave through the Lusiad,--

  The murmurs of the storm-cape ocean
  Indrawn in vibrative emotion
  Along the verse. And, while devotion

  In his wild eyes fantastic shone
  Under the tonsure blown upon
  By airs celestial, Calderon.

  And bold De Vega, who breathed quick
  Verse after verse, till death's old trick
  Put pause to life and rhetoric.

  And Goethe, with that reaching eye
  His soul reached out from, far and high,
  And fell from inner entity.

  And Schiller, with heroic front
  Worthy of Plutarch's kiss upon 't,
  Too large for wreath of modern wont.

  And Chaucer, with his infantine
  Familiar clasp of things divine;
  That mark upon his lip is wine.

  Here, Milton's eyes strike piercing-dim:
  The shapes of suns and stars did swim
  Like clouds from them, and granted him

  God for sole vision. Cowley, there,
  Whose active fancy debonair
  Drew straws like amber--foul to fair.

  Drayton and Browne, with smiles they drew
  From outward nature, still kept new
  From their own inward nature true.

  And Marlowe, Webster, Fletcher, Ben,
  Whose fire-hearts sowed our furrows when
  The world was worthy of such men.

  And Burns, with pungent passionings
  Set in his eyes: deep lyric springs
  Are of the fire-mount's issuings.

  And Shelley, in his white ideal,
  All statue-blind. And Keats the real
  Adonis with the hymeneal

  Fresh vernal buds half sunk between
  His youthful curls, kissed straight and sheen
  In his Rome-grave, by Venus queen.

  And poor, proud Byron, sad as grave
  And salt as life; forlornly brave,
  And quivering with the dart he drave.

  And visionary Coleridge, who
  Did sweep his thoughts as angels do
  Their wings with cadence up the Blue.

  These poets faced (and many more)
  The lighted altar looming o'er
  The clouds of incense dim and hoar:

  And all their faces, in the lull
  Of natural things, looked wonderful
  With life and death and deathless rule.

  All, still as stone and yet intense;
  As if by spirit's vehemence
  That stone were carved and not by sense.

  But where the heart of each should beat,
  There seemed a wound instead of it,
  From whence the blood dropped to their feet

  Drop after drop--dropped heavily
  As century follows century
  Into the deep eternity.

  Then said the lady--and her word
  Came distant, as wide waves were stirred
  Between her and the ear that heard,--

  "World's use is cold, world's love is vain,
  World's cruelty is bitter bane,
  But pain is not the fruit of pain.

  "Hearken, O poet, whom I led
  From the dark wood: dismissing dread,
  Now hear this angel in my stead.

  "His organ's clavier strikes along
  These poets' hearts, sonorous, strong,
  They gave him without count of wrong,--

  "A diapason whence to guide
  Up to God's feet, from these who died,
  An anthem fully glorified--

  "Whereat God's blessing, IBARAK (=yivarech=)
  Breathes back this music, folds it back
  About the earth in vapoury rack,

  "And men walk in it, crying 'Lo
  The world is wider, and we know
  The very heavens look brighter so:

  "'The stars move statelier round the edge
  Of the silver spheres, and give in pledge
  Their light for nobler privilege:

  "'No little flower but joys or grieves,
  Full life is rustling in the sheaves,
  Full spirit sweeps the forest-leaves.'

  "So works this music on the earth,
  God so admits it, sends it forth
  To add another worth to worth--

  "A new creation-bloom that rounds
  The old creation and expounds
  His Beautiful in tuneful sounds.

  "Now hearken!" Then the poet gazed
  Upon the angel glorious-faced
  Whose hand, majestically raised,

  Floated across the organ-keys,
  Like a pale moon o'er murmuring seas,
  With no touch but with influences:

  Then rose and fell (with swell and swound
  Of shapeless noises wandering round
  A concord which at last they found)

  Those mystic keys: the tones were mixed,
  Dim, faint, and thrilled and throbbed betwixt
  The incomplete and the unfixed:

  And therein mighty minds were heard
  In mighty musings, inly stirred,
  And struggling outward for a word:

  Until these surges, having run
  This way and that, gave out as one
  An Aphroditè of sweet tune,

  A Harmony that, finding vent,
  Upward in grand ascension went,
  Winged to a heavenly argument,

  Up, upward like a saint who strips
  The shroud back from his eyes and lips,
  And rises in apocalypse:

  A harmony sublime and plain,
  Which cleft (as flying swan, the rain,--
  Throwing the drops off with a strain

  Of her white wing) those undertones
  Of perplext chords, and soared at once
  And struck out from the starry thrones

  Their several silver octaves as
  It passed to God. The music was
  Of divine stature; strong to pass:

  And those who heard it, understood
  Something of life in spirit and blood,
  Something of nature's fair and good:

  And while it sounded, those great souls
  Did thrill as racers at the goals
  And burn in all their aureoles;

  But she the lady, as vapour-bound,
  Stood calmly in the joy of sound,
  Like Nature with the showers around:

  And when it ceased, the blood which fell
  Again, alone grew audible,
  Tolling the silence as a bell.

  The sovran angel lifted high
  His hand, and spake out sovranly:
  "Tried poets, hearken and reply!

  "Give me true answers. If we grant
  That not to suffer, is to want
  The conscience of the jubilant,--

  "If ignorance of anguish is
  But ignorance, and mortals miss
  Far prospects, by a level bliss,--

  "If, as two colours must be viewed
  In a visible image, mortals should
  Need good and evil, to see good,--

  "If to speak nobly, comprehends
  To feel profoundly,--if the ends
  Of power and suffering, Nature blends,--

  "If poets on the tripod must
  Writhe like the Pythian to make just
  Their oracles and merit trust,--

  "If every vatic word that sweeps
  To change the world must pale their lips
  And leave their own souls in eclipse,--

  "If to search deep the universe
  Must pierce the searcher with the curse,
  Because that bolt (in man's reverse)

  "Was shot to the heart o' the wood and lies
  Wedged deepest in the best,--if eyes
  That look for visions and surprise

  "From influent angels, must shut down
  Their eyelids first to sun and moon,
  The head asleep upon a stone,--

  "If ONE who did redeem you back,
  By His own loss, from final wrack,
  Did consecrate by touch and track

  "Those temporal sorrows till the taste
  Of brackish waters of the waste
  Is salt with tears He dropt too fast,--

  "If all the crowns of earth must wound
  With prickings of the thorns He found,--
  If saddest sighs swell sweetest sound,--

  "What say ye unto this?--refuse
  This baptism in salt water?--choose
  Calm breasts, mute lips, and labour loose?

  "Or, O ye gifted givers! ye
  Who give your liberal hearts to me
  To make the world this harmony,

  "Are ye resigned that they be spent
  To such world's help?"
                          The Spirits bent
  Their awful brows and said "Content."

  Content! it sounded like Amen
  Said by a choir of mourning men;
  An affirmation full of pain

  And patience,--ay, of glorying
  And adoration, as a king
  Might seal an oath for governing.

  Then said the angel--and his face
  Lightened abroad until the place
  Grew larger for a moment's space,--

  The long aisles flashing out in light,
  And nave and transept, columns white
  And arches crossed, being clear to sight

  As if the roof were off and all
  Stood in the noon-sun,--"Lo, I call
  To other hearts as liberal.

  "This pedal strikes out in the air:
  My instrument has room to bear
  Still fuller strains and perfecter.

  "Herein is room, and shall be room
  While Time lasts, for new hearts to come
  Consummating while they consume.

  "What living man will bring a gift
  Of his own heart and help to lift
  The tune?--The race is to the swift."

  So asked the angel. Straight the while,
  A company came up the aisle
  With measured step and sorted smile;

  Cleaving the incense-clouds that rise,
  With winking unaccustomed eyes
  And love-locks smelling sweet of spice.

  One bore his head above the rest
  As if the world were dispossessed,
  And one did pillow chin on breast,

  Right languid, an as he should faint;
  One shook his curls across his paint
  And moralized on worldly taint;

  One, slanting up his face, did wink
  The salt rheum to the eyelid's brink,
  To think--O gods! or--not to think.

  Some trod out stealthily and slow,
  As if the sun would fall in snow
  If they walked to instead of fro;

  And some, with conscious ambling free,
  Did shake their bells right daintily
  On hand and foot, for harmony;

  And some, composing sudden sighs
  In attitudes of point-device,
  Rehearsed impromptu agonies.

  And when this company drew near
  The spirits crowned, it might appear
  Submitted to a ghastly fear;

  As a sane eye in master-passion
  Constrains a maniac to the fashion
  Of hideous maniac imitation

  In the least geste--the dropping low
  O' the lid, the wrinkling of the brow,
  Exaggerate with mock and mow,--

  So mastered was that company
  By the crowned vision utterly,
  Swayed to a maniac mockery.

  One dulled his eyeballs, as they ached
  With Homer's forehead, though he lacked
  An inch of any; and one racked

  His lower lip with restless tooth,
  As Pindar's rushing words forsooth
  Were pent behind it; one his smooth

  Pink cheeks did rumple passionate
  Like Æschylus, and tried to prate
  On trolling tongue of fate and fate;

  One set her eyes like Sappho's--or
  Any light woman's; one forbore
  Like Dante, or any man as poor

  In mirth, to let a smile undo
  His hard-shut lips; and one that drew
  Sour humours from his mother, blew

  His sunken cheeks out to the size
  Of most unnatural jollities,
  Because Anacreon looked jest-wise;

  So with the rest: it was a sight
  A great world-laughter would requite,
  Or great world-wrath, with equal right

  Out came a speaker from that crowd
  To speak for all, in sleek and proud
  Exordial periods, while he bowed

  His knee before the angel--"Thus,
  O angel who hast called for us,
  We bring thee service emulous,

  "Fit service from sufficient soul,
  Hand-service to receive world's dole,
  Lip-service in world's ear to roll

  "Adjusted concords soft enow
  To hear the wine-cups passing, through,
  And not too grave to spoil the show:

  "Thou, certes, when thou askest more,
  O sapient angel, leanest o'er
  The window-sill of metaphor.

  "To give our hearts up? fie! that rage
  Barbaric antedates the age;
  It is not done on any stage.

  "Because your scald or gleeman went
  With seven or nine-stringed instrument
  Upon his back,--must ours be bent?

  "We are not pilgrims, by your leave;
  No, nor yet martyrs; if we grieve,
  It is to rhyme to--summer eve:

  "And if we labour, it shall be
  As suiteth best with our degree,
  In after-dinner reverie."

  More yet that speaker would have said,
  Poising between his smiles fair-fed
  Each separate phrase till finishèd;

  But all the foreheads of those born
  And dead true poets flashed with scorn
  Betwixt the bay leaves round them worn,

  Ay, jetted such brave fire that they,
  The new-come, shrank and paled away
  Like leaden ashes when the day

  Strikes on the hearth. A spirit-blast,
  A presence known by power, at last
  Took them up mutely: they had passed.

  And he our pilgrim-poet saw
  Only their places, in deep awe,
  What time the angel's smile did draw

  His gazing upward. Smiling on,
  The angel in the angel shone,
  Revealing glory in benison;

  Till, ripened in the light which shut
  The poet in, his spirit mute
  Dropped sudden as a perfect fruit;

  He fell before the angel's feet,
  Saying, "If what is true is sweet,
  In something I may compass it:

  "For, where my worthiness is poor,
  My will stands richly at the door
  To pay shortcomings evermore.

  "Accept me therefore: not for price
  And not for pride my sacrifice
  Is tendered, for my soul is nice

  "And will beat down those dusty seeds
  Of bearded corn if she succeeds
  In soaring while the covey feeds.

  "I soar, I am drawn up like the lark
  To its white cloud--so high my mark,
  Albeit my wing is small and dark.

  "I ask no wages, seek no fame:
  Sew me, for shroud round face and name,
  God's banner of the oriflamme.

  "I only would have leave to loose
  (In tears and blood if so He choose)
  Mine inward music out to use:

  "I only would be spent--in pain
  And loss, perchance, but not in vain--
  Upon the sweetness of that strain;

  "Only project beyond the bound
  Of mine own life, so lost and found,
  My voice, and live on in its sound;

  "Only embrace and be embraced
  By fiery ends, whereby to waste,
  And light God's future with my past."

  The angel's smile grew more divine,
  The mortal speaking; ay, its shine
  Swelled fuller, like a choir-note fine,

  Till the broad glory round his brow
  Did vibrate with the light below;
  But what he said I do not know.

  Nor know I if the man who prayed,
  Rose up accepted, unforbade,
  From the church-floor where he was laid,--

  Nor if a listening life did run
  Through the king-poets, one by one
  Rejoicing in a worthy son:

  My soul, which might have seen, grew blind
  By what it looked on: I can find
  No certain count of things behind.

  I saw alone, dim, white and grand
  As in a dream, the angel's hand
  Stretched forth in gesture of command

  Straight through the haze. And so, as erst,
  A strain more noble than the first
  Mused in the organ, and outburst:

  With giant march from floor to roof
  Rose the full notes, now parted off
  In pauses massively aloof

  Like measured thunders, now rejoined
  In concords of mysterious kind
  Which fused together sense and mind,

  Now flashing sharp on sharp along
  Exultant in a mounting throng,
  Now dying off to a low song

  Fed upon minors, wavelike sounds
  Re-eddying into silver rounds,
  Enlarging liberty with bounds:

  And every rhythm that seemed to close
  Survived in confluent underflows
  Symphonious with the next that rose.

  Thus the whole strain being multiplied
  And greatened, with its glorified
  Wings shot abroad from side to side,

  Waved backward (as a wind might wave
  A Brocken mist and with as brave
  Wild roaring) arch and architrave,

  Aisle, transept, column, marble wall,--
  Then swelling outward, prodigal
  Of aspiration beyond thrall,

  Soared, and drew up with it the whole
  Of this said vision, as a soul
  Is raised by a thought. And as a scroll

  Of bright devices is unrolled
  Still upward with a gradual gold,
  So rose the vision manifold,

  Angel and organ, and the round
  Of spirits, solemnized and crowned;
  While the freed clouds of incense wound

  Ascending, following in their track,
  And glimmering faintly like the rack
  O' the moon in her own light cast back.

  And as that solemn dream withdrew,
  The lady's kiss did fall anew
  Cold on the poet's brow as dew.

  And that same kiss which bound him first
  Beyond the senses, now reversed
  Its own law and most subtly pierced

  His spirit with the sense of things
  Sensual and present. Vanishings
  Of glory with Æolian wings

  Struck him and passed: the lady's face
  Did melt back in the chrysopras
  Of the orient morning sky that was

  Yet clear of lark and there and so
  She melted as a star might do,
  Still smiling as she melted slow:

  Smiling so slow, he seemed to see
  Her smile the last thing, gloriously
  Beyond her, far as memory.

  Then he looked round: he was alone.
  He lay before the breaking sun,
  As Jacob at the Bethel stone.

  And thought's entangled skein being wound,
  He knew the moorland of his swound,
  And the pale pools that smeared the ground;

  The far wood-pines like offing ships;
  The fourth pool's yew anear him drips,
  World's cruelty attaints his lips,

  And still he tastes it, bitter still;
  Through all that glorious possible
  He had the sight of present ill.

  Yet rising calmly up and slowly
  With such a cheer as scorneth folly,
  A mild delightsome melancholy,

  He journeyed homeward through the wood
  And prayed along the solitude
  Betwixt the pines, "O God, my God!"

  The golden morning's open flowings
  Did sway the trees to murmurous bowings,
  In metric chant of blessed poems.

  And passing homeward through the wood,
  He prayed along the solitude,
  "THOU, Poet-God, art great and good!

  "And though we must have, and have had
  Right reason to be earthly sad,
  THOU, Poet-God, art great and glad!"


CONCLUSION.

  Life treads on life, and heart on heart;
  We press too close in church and mart
  To keep a dream or grave apart:

  And I was 'ware of walking down
  That same green forest where had gone
  The poet-pilgrim. One by one

  I traced his footsteps. From the east
  A red and tender radiance pressed
  Through the near trees, until I guessed

  The sun behind shone full and round;
  While up the leafiness profound
  A wind scarce old enough for sound

  Stood ready to blow on me when
  I turned that way, and now and then
  The birds sang and brake off again

  To shake their pretty feathers dry
  Of the dew sliding droppingly
  From the leaf-edges and apply

  Back to their song: 'twixt dew and bird
  So sweet a silence ministered,
  God seemed to use it for a word,

  Yet morning souls did leap and run
  In all things, as the least had won
  A joyous insight of the sun,

  And no one looking round the wood
  Could help confessing as he stood,
  This Poet-God is glad and good.

  But hark! a distant sound that grows,
  A heaving, sinking of the boughs,
  A rustling murmur, not of those,

  A breezy noise which is not breeze!
  And white-clad children by degrees
  Steal out in troops among the trees,

  Fair little children morning-bright,
  With faces grave yet soft to sight,
  Expressive of restrained delight.

  Some plucked the palm-boughs within reach,
  And others leapt up high to catch
  The upper boughs and shake from each

  A rain of dew till, wetted so,
  The child who held the branch let go
  And it swang backward with a flow

  Of faster drippings. Then I knew
  The children laughed; but the laugh flew
  From its own chirrup as might do

  A frightened song-bird; and a child
  Who seemed the chief said very mild,
  "Hush! keep this morning undefiled."

  His eyes rebuked them from calm spheres,
  His soul upon his brow appears
  In waiting for more holy years.

  I called the child to me, and said,
  "What are your palms for?" "To be spread,"
  He answered, "on a poet dead.

  "The poet died last month, and now
  The world which had been somewhat slow
  In honouring his living brow,

  "Commands the palms; they must be strown
  On his new marble very soon,
  In a procession of the town."

  I sighed and said, "Did he foresee
  Any such honour?" "Verily
  I cannot tell you," answered he.

  "But this I know, I fain would lay
  My own head down, another day,
  As he did,--with the fame away.

  "A lily, a friend's hand had plucked,
  Lay by his death-bed, which he looked
  As deep down as a bee had sucked,

  "Then, turning to the lattice, gazed
  O'er hill and river and upraised
  His eyes illumined and amazed

  "With the world's beauty, up to God,
  Re-offering on their iris broad
  The images of things bestowed

  "By the chief Poet. 'God!' he cried,
  'Be praised for anguish which has tried,
  For beauty which has satisfied:

  "'For this world's presence half within
  And half without me--thought and scene--
  This sense of Being and Having Been.

  "'I thank Thee that my soul hath room
  For Thy grand world: both guests may come--
  Beauty, to soul--Body, to tomb.

  "'I am content to be so weak:
  Put strength into the words I speak,
  And I am strong in what I seek.

  "'I am content to be so bare
  Before the archers, everywhere
  My wounds being stroked by heavenly air.

  "'I laid my soul before Thy feet
  That images of fair and sweet
  Should walk to other men on it.

  "'I am content to feel the step
  Of each pure image: let those keep
  To mandragore who care to sleep.

  "'I am content to touch the brink
  Of the other goblet and I think
  My bitter drink a wholesome drink.

  "'Because my portion was assigned
  Wholesome and bitter, Thou art kind,
  And I am blessed to my mind.

  "'Gifted for giving, I receive
  The maythorn and its scent outgive:
  I grieve not that I once did grieve.

  "'In my large joy of sight and touch
  Beyond what others count for such,
  I am content to suffer much.

  "'I know--is all the mourner saith,
  Knowledge by suffering entereth,
  And Life is perfected by Death.'"

  The child spake nobly: strange to hear,
  His infantine soft accents clear
  Charged with high meanings, did appear;

  And fair to see, his form and face
  Winged out with whiteness and pure grace
  From the green darkness of the place.

  Behind his head a palm-tree grew;
  An orient beam which pierced it through
  Transversely on his forehead drew

  The figure of a palm-branch brown
  Traced on its brightness up and down
  In fine fair lines,--a shadow-crown:

  Guido might paint his angels so--
  A little angel, taught to go
  With holy words to saints below--

  Such innocence of action yet
  Significance of object met
  In his whole bearing strong and sweet.

  And all the children, the whole band,
  Did round in rosy reverence stand,
  Each with a palm-bough in his hand.

  "And so he died," I whispered. "Nay,
  Not so," the childish voice did say,
  "That poet turned him first to pray

  "In silence, and God heard the rest
  'Twixt the sun's footsteps down the west.
  Then he called one who loved him best,

  "Yea, he called softly through the room
  (His voice was weak yet tender)--'Come,'
  He said, 'come nearer! Let the bloom

  "'Of Life grow over, undenied,
  This bridge of Death, which is not wide--
  I shall be soon at the other side.

  "'Come, kiss me!' So the one in truth
  Who loved him best,--in love, not ruth,
  Bowed down and kissed him mouth to mouth:

  "And in that kiss of love was won
  Life's manumission. All was done:
  The mouth that kissed last, kissed alone.

  "But in the former, confluent kiss,
  The same was sealed, I think, by His,
  To words of truth and uprightness."

  The child's voice trembled, his lips shook
  Like a rose leaning o'er a brook,
  Which vibrates though it is not struck.

  "And who," I asked, a little moved
  Yet curious-eyed, "was this that loved
  And kissed him last, as it behoved?"

  "I," softly said the child; and then
  "I," said he louder, once again:
  "His son, my rank is among men:

  "And now that men exalt his name
  I come to gather palms with them,
  That holy love may hallow fame.

  "He did not die alone, nor should
  His memory live so, 'mid these rude
  World-praisers--a worse solitude.

  "Me, a voice calleth to that tomb
  Where these are strewing branch and bloom
  Saying, 'Come nearer:' and I come.

  "Glory to God!" resumèd he,
  And his eyes smiled for victory
  O'er their own tears which I could see

  Fallen on the palm, down cheek and chin--
  "That poet now has entered in
  The place of rest which is not sin.

  "And while he rests, his songs in troops
  Walk up and down our earthly slopes,
  Companioned by diviner hopes."

  "But thou," I murmured to engage
  The child's speech farther--"hast an age
  Too tender for this orphanage."

  "Glory to God--to God!" he saith:
  "KNOWLEDGE BY SUFFERING ENTERETH,
  AND LIFE IS PERFECTED BY DEATH."




THE POET'S VOW


                       O be wiser thou,
Instructed that true knowledge leads to love.

                                    WORDSWORTH.




THE POET'S VOW.


PART THE FIRST.

SHOWING WHEREFORE THE VOW WAS MADE.


  I.

  Eve is a twofold mystery;
    The stillness Earth doth keep,
  The motion wherewith human hearts
    Do each to either leap
  As if all souls between the poles
    Felt "Parting comes in sleep."


  II.

  The rowers lift their oars to view
    Each other in the sea;
  The landsmen watch the rocking boats
    In a pleasant company;
  While up the hill go gladlier still
    Dear friends by two and three.


  III.

  The peasant's wife hath looked without
    Her cottage door and smiled,
  For there the peasant drops his spade
    To clasp his youngest child
  Which hath no speech, but its hand can reach
    And stroke his forehead mild.


  IV.

  A poet sate that eventide
    Within his hall alone,
  As silent as its ancient lords
    In the coffined place of stone,
  When the bat hath shrunk from the praying monk,
    And the praying monk is gone.


  V.

  Nor wore the dead a stiller face
    Beneath the cerement's roll:
  His lips refusing out in words
    Their mystic thoughts to dole,
  His steadfast eye burnt inwardly,
    As burning out his soul.


  VI.

  You would not think that brow could e'er
    Ungentle moods express,
  Yet seemed it, in this troubled world,
    Too calm for gentleness,
  When the very star that shines from far
    Shines trembling ne'ertheless.


  VII.

  It lacked, all need, the softening light
    Which other brows supply:
  We should conjoin the scathèd trunks
    Of our humanity,
  That each leafless spray entwining may
    Look softer 'gainst the sky.


  VIII.

  None gazed within the poet's face,
    The poet gazed in none;
  He threw a lonely shadow straight
    Before the moon and sun,
  Affronting nature's heaven-dwelling creatures
    With wrong to nature done:


  IX.

  Because this poet daringly,
    --The nature at his heart,
  And that quick tune along his veins
    He could not change by art,--
  Had vowed his blood of brotherhood
    To a stagnant place apart.


  X.

  He did not vow in fear, or wrath,
    Or grief's fantastic whim,
  But, weights and shows of sensual things
    Too closely crossing him,
  On his soul's eyelid the pressure slid
    And made its vision dim.


  XI.

  And darkening in the dark he strove
    'Twixt earth and sea and sky
  To lose in shadow, wave and cloud,
    His brother's haunting cry:
  The winds were welcome as they swept,
  God's five-day work he would accept,
    But let the rest go by.


  XII.

  He cried, "O touching, patient Earth
    That weepest in thy glee,
  Whom God created very good,
    And very mournful, we!
  Thy voice of moan doth reach His throne,
    As Abel's rose from thee.


  XIII.

  "Poor crystal sky with stars astray!
    Mad winds that howling go
  From east to west! perplexèd seas
    That stagger from their blow!
  O motion wild! O wave defiled!
    Our curse hath made you so.


  XIV.

  'We! and our curse! do I partake
    The desiccating sin?
  Have I the apple at my lips?
    The money-lust within?
  Do I human stand with the wounding hand,
    To the blasting heart akin?


  XV.

  "Thou solemn pathos of all things
    For solemn joy designed!
  Behold, submissive to your cause,
    A holy wrath I find
  And, for your sake, the bondage break
    That knits me to my kind.


  XVI.

  "Hear me forswear man's sympathies,
    His pleasant yea and no,
  His riot on the piteous earth
   Whereon his thistles grow,
  His changing love--with stars above,
    His pride--with graves below.


  XVII.

  "Hear me forswear his roof by night,
    His bread and salt by day,
  His talkings at the wood-fire hearth,
    His greetings by the way,
  His answering looks, his systemed books,
    All man, for aye and aye.


  XVIII.

  "That so my purged, once human heart,
    From all the human rent,
  May gather strength to pledge and drink
    Your wine of wonderment,
  While you pardon me all blessingly
    The woe mine Adam sent.


  XIX.

  "And I shall feel your unseen looks
    Innumerous, constant, deep
  And soft as haunted Adam once,
    Though sadder, round me creep,--
  As slumbering men have mystic ken
    Of watchers on their sleep.


  XX.

  "And ever, when I lift my brow
    At evening to the sun,
  No voice of woman or of child
    Recording 'Day is done.'
  Your silences shall a love express,
    More deep than such an one."


PART THE SECOND.

SHOWING TO WHOM THE VOW WAS DECLARED.


  I.

  The poet's vow was inly sworn,
    The poet's vow was told.
  He shared among his crowding friends
    The silver and the gold,
  They clasping bland his gift,--his hand
    In a somewhat slacker hold.


  II.

  They wended forth, the crowding friends,
    With farewells smooth and kind.
  They wended forth, the solaced friends,
    And left but twain behind:
  One loved him true as brothers do,
    And one was Rosalind.


  III.

  He said, "My friends have wended forth
    With farewells smooth and kind;
  Mine oldest friend, my plighted bride,
    Ye need not stay behind:
  Friend, wed my fair bride for my sake,
  And let my lands ancestral make
    A dower for Rosalind.


  IV.

  "And when beside your wassail board
    Ye bless your social lot,
  I charge you that the giver be
    In all his gifts forgot,
  Or alone of all his words recall
    The last,--Lament me not."


  V.

  She looked upon him silently
    With her large, doubting eyes,
  Like a child that never knew but love
    Whom words of wrath surprise,
  Till the rose did break from either cheek
    And the sudden tears did rise.


  VI.

  She looked upon him mournfully,
    While her large eyes were grown
  Yet larger with the steady tears,
    Till, all his purpose known,
  She turnèd slow, as she would go--
    The tears were shaken down.


  VII.

  She turnèd slow, as she would go,
    Then quickly turned again,
  And gazing in his face to seek
    Some little touch of pain,
  "I thought," she said,--but shook her head,--
    She tried that speech in vain.


  VIII.

  "I thought--but I am half a child
    And very sage art thou--
  The teachings of the heaven and earth
    Should keep us soft and low:
  They have drawn my tears in early years,
    Or ere I wept--as now.


  IX.

  "But now that in thy face I read
    Their cruel homily,
  Before their beauty I would fain
    Untouched, unsoftened be,--
  If I indeed could look on even
  The senseless, loveless earth and heaven
    As thou canst look on me!


  X.

  "And couldest thou as coldly view
    Thy childhood's far abode,
  Where little feet kept time with thine
    Along the dewy sod,
  And thy mother's look from holy book
    Rose like a thought of God?


  XI.

  "O brother,--called so, ere her last
    Betrothing words were said!
  O fellow-watcher in her room,
    With hushèd voice and tread!
  Rememberest thou how, hand in hand
  O friend, O lover, we did stand,
    And knew that she was dead?


  XII.

  "I will not live Sir Roland's bride,
    That dower I will not hold;
  I tread below my feet that go,
    These parchments bought and sold:
  The tears I weep are mine to keep,
    And worthier than thy gold."


  XIII.

  The poet and Sir Roland stood
    Alone, each turned to each,
  Till Roland brake the silence left
    By that soft-throbbing speech--
  "Poor heart!" he cried, "it vainly tried
    The distant heart to reach.


  XIV.

  "And thou, O distant, sinful heart
    That climbest up so high
  To wrap and blind thee with the snows
    That cause to dream and die,
  What blessing can, from lips of man,
    Approach thee with his sigh?


  XV.

  "Ay, what from earth--create for man
    And moaning in his moan?
  Ay, what from stars--revealed to man
    And man-named one by one?
  Ay, more! what blessing can be given
  Where the Spirits seven do show in heaven
    A MAN upon the throne?


  XVI.

  "A man on earth HE wandered once,
    All meek and undefiled,
  And those who loved Him said 'He wept'--
    None ever said He smiled;
  Yet there might have been a smile unseen,
  When He bowed his holy face, I ween,
    To bless that happy child.


  XVII.

  "And now HE pleadeth up in heaven
    For our humanities,
  Till the ruddy light on seraphs' wings
    In pale emotion dies.
  They can better bear their Godhead's glare
    Than the pathos of his eyes.


  XVIII.

  "I will go pray our God to-day
    To teach thee how to scan
  His work divine, for human use
    Since earth on axle ran,--
  To teach thee to discern as plain
  His grief divine, the blood-drop's stain
    He left there, MAN for man.


  XIX.

  "So, for the blood's sake shed by Him
    Whom angels God declare,
  Tears like it, moist and warm with love,
    Thy reverent eyes shall wear
  To see i' the face of Adam's race
    The nature God doth share."


  XX.

  "I heard," the poet said, "thy voice
    As dimly as thy breath:
  The sound was like the noise of life
    To one anear his death,--
  Or of waves that fail to stir the pale
    Sere leaf they roll beneath.


  XXI.

  "And still between the sound and me
    White creatures like a mist
  Did interfloat confusedly,
    Mysterious shapes unwist:
  Across my heart and across my brow
  I felt them droop like wreaths of snow,
    To still the pulse they kist.


  XXII.

  "The castle and its lands are thine--
    The poor's--it shall be done.
  Go, man, to love! I go to live
    In Courland hall, alone:
  The bats along the ceilings cling,
  The lizards in the floors do run,
  And storms and years have worn and reft
  The stain by human builders left
    In working at the stone."


PART THE THIRD.

SHOWING HOW THE VOW WAS KEPT.


  I.

  He dwelt alone, and sun and moon
    Were witness that he made
  Rejection of his humanness
    Until they seemed to fade;
  His face did so, for he did grow
    Of his own soul afraid.


  II.

  The self-poised God may dwell alone
    With inward glorying,
  But God's chief angel waiteth for
    A brother's voice, to sing;
  And a lonely creature of sinful nature
    It is an awful thing.


  III.

  An awful thing that feared itself;
    While many years did roll,
  A lonely man, a feeble man,
    A part beneath the whole,
  He bore by day, he bore by night
  That pressure of God's infinite
    Upon his finite soul.


  IV.

  The poet at his lattice sate,
    And downward lookèd he.
  Three Christians wended by to prayers,
    With mute ones in their ee;
  Each turned above a face of love
    And called him to the far chapèlle
  With voice more tuneful than its bell:
    But still they wended three.


  V.

  There journeyed by a bridal pomp,
    A bridegroom and his dame;
  He speaketh low for happiness,
    She blusheth red for shame:
  But never a tone of benison
    From out the lattice came.


  VI.

  A little child with inward song,
    No louder noise to dare,
  Stood near the wall to see at play
    The lizards green and rare--
  Unblessed the while for his childish smile
    Which cometh unaware.


PART THE FOURTH.

SHOWING HOW ROSALIND FARED BY THE KEEPING OF THE VOW.


  I.

  In death-sheets lieth Rosalind
    As white and still as they;
  And the old nurse that watched her bed
    Rose up with "Well-a-day!"
  And oped the casement to let in
  The sun, and that sweet doubtful din
  Which droppeth from the grass and bough
  Sans wind and bird, none knoweth how--
    To cheer her as she lay.


  II.

  The old nurse started when she saw
    Her sudden look of woe:
  But the quick wan tremblings round her mouth
    In a meek smile did go,
  And calm she said, "When I am dead,
    Dear nurse it shall be so.


  III.

  "Till then, shut out those sights and sounds,
    And pray God pardon me
  That I without this pain no more
    His blessed works can see!
  And lean beside me, loving nurse,
  That thou mayst hear, ere I am worse,
    What thy last love should be."


  IV.

  The loving nurse leant over her,
    As white she lay beneath;
  The old eyes searching, dim with life,
    The young ones dim with death,
  To read their look if sound forsook
    The trying, trembling breath.


  V.

  "When all this feeble breath is done,
    And I on bier am laid,
  My tresses smoothed for never a feast,
    My body in shroud arrayed,
  Uplift each palm in a saintly calm,
    As if that still I prayed.


  VI.

  "And heap beneath mine head the flowers
    You stoop so low to pull,
  The little white flowers from the wood
    Which grow there in the cool,
  Which he and I, in childhood's games,
  Went plucking, knowing not their names,
    And filled thine apron full.


  VII.

  "Weep not! I weep not. Death is strong,
    The eyes of Death are dry!
  But lay this scroll upon my breast
    When hushed its heavings lie,
  And wait awhile for the corpse's smile
    Which shineth presently.


  VIII.

  "And when it shineth, straightway call
    Thy youngest children dear,
  And bid them gently carry me
    All barefaced on the bier;
  But bid them pass my kirkyard grass
    That waveth long anear.


  IX.

  "And up the bank where I used to sit
    And dream what life would be,
  Along the brook with its sunny look
    Akin to living glee,--
  O'er the windy hill, through the forest still,
    Let them gently carry me.


  X.

  "And through the piny forest still,
    And down the open moorland
  Round where the sea beats mistily
    And blindly on the foreland;
  And let them chant that hymn I know,
  Bearing me soft, bearing me slow,
    To the ancient hall of Courland.


  XI.

  "And when withal they near the hall,
    In silence let them lay
  My bier before the bolted door,
    And leave it for a day:
  For I have vowed, though I am proud,
  To go there as a guest in shroud,
    And not be turned away."


  XII.

  The old nurse looked within her eyes
    Whose mutual look was gone;
  The old nurse stooped upon her mouth,
    Whose answering voice was done;
  And nought she heard, till a little bird
    Upon the casement's woodbine swinging
  Broke out into a loud sweet singing
    For joy o' the summer sun:
  "Alack! alack!"--she watched no more,
    With head on knee she wailèd sore,
  And the little bird sang o'er and o'er
    For joy o' the summer sun.


PART THE FIFTH.

SHOWING HOW THE VOW WAS BROKEN.


  I.

  The poet oped his bolted door
    The midnight sky to view;
  A spirit-feel was in the air
  Which seemed to touch his spirit bare
    Whenever his breath he drew;
  And the stars a liquid softness had,
  As alone their holiness forbade
    Their falling with the dew.


  II.

  They shine upon the steadfast hills,
    Upon the swinging tide,
  Upon the narrow track of beach
    And the murmuring pebbles pied:
  They shine on every lovely place,
  They shine upon the corpse's face,
    As it were fair beside.


  III.

  It lay before him, humanlike,
    Yet so unlike a thing!
  More awful in its shrouded pomp
    Than any crownèd king:
  All calm and cold, as it did hold
    Some secret, glorying.


  IV.

  A heavier weight than of its clay
    Clung to his heart and knee:
  As if those folded palms could strike
    He staggered groaningly,
  And then o'erhung, without a groan,
  The meek close mouth that smiled alone,
    Whose speech the scroll must be.

       *       *       *       *       *


  THE WORDS OF ROSALIND'S SCROLL.

  "I left thee last, a child at heart,
    A woman scarce in years.
  I come to thee, a solemn corpse
    Which neither feels nor fears.
  I have no breath to use in sighs;
  They laid the dead-weights on mine eyes
    To seal them safe from tears.

  "Look on me with thine own calm look:
    I meet it calm as thou.
  No look of thine can change this smile,
    Or break thy sinful vow:
  I tell thee that my poor scorned heart
  Is of thine earth--thine earth, a part:
    It cannot vex thee now.

  "But out, alas! these words are writ
    By a living, loving one,
  Adown whose cheeks, the proofs of life
    The warm quick tears do run:
  Ah, let the unloving corpse control
  Thy scorn back from the loving soul
    Whose place of rest is won.

  "I have prayed for thee with bursting sob
    When passion's course was free;
  I have prayed for thee with silent lips,
    In the anguish none could see:
  They whispered oft, 'She sleepeth soft'--
    But I only prayed for thee.

  "Go to! I pray for thee no more:
    The corpse's tongue is still,
  Its folded fingers point to heaven,
    But point there stiff and chill:
  No farther wrong, no farther woe
  Hath license from the sin below
    Its tranquil heart to thrill.

  "I charge thee, by the living's prayer,
    And the dead's silentness,
  To wring from out thy soul a cry
    Which God shall hear and bless!
  Lest Heaven's own palm droop in my hand,
  And pale among the saints I stand,
    A saint companionless."

       *       *       *       *       *


  V.

  Bow lower down before the throne,
    Triumphant Rosalind!
  He boweth on thy corpse his face,
    And weepeth as the blind:
  'Twas a dread sight to see them so,
  For the senseless corpse rocked to and fro
    With the wail of his living mind.


  VI.

  But dreader sight, could such be seen,
    His inward mind did lie,
  Whose long-subjected humanness
    Gave out its lion-cry,
  And fiercely rent its tenement
    In a mortal agony.


  VII.

  I tell you, friends, had you heard his wail,
    'Twould haunt you in court and mart,
  And in merry feast until you set
    Your cup down to depart--
  That weeping wild of a reckless child
    From a proud man's broken heart.


  VIII.

  O broken heart, O broken vow,
    That wore so proud a feature!
  God, grasping as a thunderbolt
    The man's rejected nature,
  Smote him therewith i' the presence high
  Of his so worshipped earth and sky
  That looked on all indifferently--
    A wailing human creature.


  IX.

  A human creature found too weak
    To bear his human pain--
  (May Heaven's dear grace have spoken peace
     To his dying heart and brain!)
  For when they came at dawn of day
  To lift the lady's corpse away,
    Her bier was holding twain.


  X.

  They dug beneath the kirkyard grass,
    For born one dwelling deep;
  To which, when years had mossed the stone,
  Sir Roland brought his little son
    To watch the funeral heap:
  And when the happy boy would rather
    Turn upward his blithe eyes to see
    The wood-doves nodding from the tree,
  "Nay, boy, look downward," said his father,
  "Upon this human dust asleep.
  And hold it in thy constant ken
  That God's own unity compresses
    (One into one) the human many,
  And that his everlastingness is
    The bond which is not loosed by any:
  That thou and I this law must keep,
    If not in love, in sorrow then,--
    Though smiling not like other men,
  Still, like them we must weep."


THE ROMAUNT OF MARGRET.

    Can my affections find out nothing best,
      But still and still remove?

    QUARLES.


    I.

      I plant a tree whose leaf
        The yew-tree leaf will suit:
    But when its shade is o'er you laid,
        Turn round and pluck the fruit.
    Now reach my harp from off the wall
        Where shines the sun aslant;
    The sun may shine and we be cold!
    O hearken, loving hearts and bold,
        Unto my wild romaunt.
                Margret, Margret.

    II.

      Sitteth the fair ladye
        Close to the river side
    Which runneth on with a merry tone
        Her merry thoughts to guide:
      It runneth through the trees,
        It runneth by the hill,
    Nathless the lady's thoughts have found
        A way more pleasant still
                Margret, Margret.

    III.

      The night is in her hair
        And giveth shade to shade,
    And the pale moonlight on her forehead white
        Like a spirit's hand is laid;
      Her lips part with a smile
        Instead of speakings done:
    I ween, she thinketh of a voice,
        Albeit uttering none.
                Margret, Margret.

    IV.

      All little birds do sit
        With heads beneath their wings:
    Nature doth seem in a mystic dream,
        Absorbed from her living things:
      That dream by that ladye
        Is certes unpartook,
    For she looketh to the high cold stars
        With a tender human look
                Margret, Margret.

    V.

      The lady's shadow lies
        Upon the running river;
    It lieth no less in its quietness,
        For that which resteth never:
      Most like a trusting heart
        Upon a passing faith,
    Or as upon the course of life
        The steadfast doom of death.
                Margret, Margret.

    VI.

      The lady doth not move,
        The lady doth not dream,
    Yet she seeth her shade no longer laid
        In rest upon the stream:
      It shaketh without wind,
        It parteth from the tide,
    It standeth upright in the cleft moonlight,
        It sitteth at her side.
                Margret, Margret.

    VII.

      Look in its face, ladye,
        And keep thee from thy swound;
    With a spirit bold thy pulses hold
        And hear its voice's sound:
      For so will sound thy voice
        When thy face is to the wall,
    And such will be thy face, ladye,
        When the maidens work thy pall.
                Margret, Margret.

    VIII.

      "Am I not like to thee?"
        The voice was calm and low,
    And between each word you might have heard
        The silent forests grow;
      "The like may sway the like;"
        By which mysterious law
    Mine eyes from thine and my lips from thine
        The light and breath may draw.
                Margret, Margret.

    IX.

      "My lips do need thy breath,
        My lips do need thy smile,
    And my pallid eyne, that light in thine
        Which met the stars erewhile:
      Yet go with light and life
        If that thou lovest one
    In all the earth who loveth thee
        As truly as the sun,
                Margret, Margret."

    X.

      Her cheek had waxèd white
        Like cloud at fall of snow;
    Then like to one at set of sun,
        It waxèd red alsò;
      For love's name maketh bold
        As if the loved were near:
    And then she sighed the deep long sigh
        Which cometh after fear.
                Margret, Margret.

    XI.

      "Now, sooth, I fear thee not--
        Shall never fear thee now!"
    (And a noble sight was the sudden light
        Which lit her lifted brow.)
      "Can earth be dry of streams,
        Or hearts of love?" she said;
    "Who doubteth love, can know not love:
        He is already dead."
                Margret, Margret.

    XII.

      "I have" ... and here her lips
        Some word in pause did keep,
    And gave the while a quiet smile
        As if they paused in sleep,--
      "I have ... a brother dear,
        A knight of knightly fame!
    I broidered him a knightly scarf
        With letters of my name
                Margret, Margret.

    XIII.

      "I fed his grey goshawk,
        I kissed his fierce bloodhoùnd,
    I sate at home when he might come
        And caught his horn's far sound:
      I sang him hunter's songs,
        I poured him the red wine,
    He looked across the cup and said,
        I love thee, sister mine."
                Margret, Margret.

    XIV.

      IT trembled on the grass
        With a low, shadowy laughter;
    The sounding river which rolled, for ever
        Stood dumb and stagnant after:
      "Brave knight thy brother is!
        But better loveth he
    Thy chaliced wine than thy chaunted song,
        And better both than thee,
                Margret, Margret."

    XV.

      The lady did not heed
        The river's silence while
    Her own thoughts still ran at their will,
        And calm was still her smile.
      "My little sister wears
        The look our mother wore:
    I smooth her locks with a golden comb,
        I bless her evermore."
                Margret, Margret.

    XVI.

      "I gave her my first bird
        When first my voice it knew;
    I made her share my posies rare
        And told her where they grew:
      I taught her God's dear name
        With prayer and praise to tell,
    She looked from heaven into my face
        And said, I love thee well."
                Margret, Margret.

    XVII.

      IT trembled on the grass
        With a low, shadowy laughter;
    You could see each bird as it woke and stared
        Through the shrivelled foliage after.
      "Fair child thy sister is!
        But better loveth she
    Thy golden comb than thy gathered flowers,
        And better both than thee,
                Margret, Margret."

    XVIII.

      Thy lady did not heed
        The withering on the bough;
    Still calm her smile albeit the while
        A little pale her brow:
      "I have a father old,
        The lord of ancient halls;
    An hundred friends are in his court
        Yet only me he calls.
                Margret, Margret.

    XIX.

      "An hundred knights are in his court
        Yet read I by his knee;
    And when forth they go to the tourney-show
        I rise not up to see:
      'T is a weary book to read,
        My tryst's at set of sun,
    But loving and dear beneath the stars
        Is his blessing when I've done."
                Margret, Margret.

    XX.

      IT trembled on the grass
        With a low, shadowy laughter;
    And moon and star though bright and far
        Did shrink and darken after.
      "High lord thy father is!
        But better loveth he
    His ancient halls than his hundred friends,
        His ancient halls, than thee,
                Margret, Margret."

    XXI.

      The lady did not heed
        That the far stars did fail;
    Still calm her smile, albeit the while ...
        Nay, but she is not pale!
      "I have more than a friend
        Across the mountains dim:
    No other's voice is soft to me,
        Unless it nameth him."
                Margret, Margret.

    XXII.

      "Though louder beats my heart,
        I know his tread again,
    And his fair plume aye, unless turned away,
        For the tears do blind me then:
      We brake no gold, a sign
        Of stronger faith to be,
    But I wear his last look in my soul,
        Which said, I love but thee!"
                Margret, Margret.

    XXIII.

      IT trembled on the grass
        With a low, shadowy laughter;
    And the wind did toll, as a passing soul
        Were sped by church-bell after;
      And shadows, 'stead of light,
        Fell from the stars above,
    In flakes of darkness on her face
        Still bright with trusting love.
                Margret, Margret.

    XXIV.

      "He loved but only thee!
        That love is transient too.
    The wild hawk's bill doth dabble still
        I' the mouth that vowed thee true:
      Will he open his dull eyes
        When tears fall on his brow?
    Behold, the death-worm to his heart
        Is a nearer thing than thou,
                Margret, Margret."

    XXV.

      Her face was on the ground--
        None saw the agony;
    But the men at sea did that night agree
        They heard a drowning cry:
      And when the morning brake,
        Fast rolled the river's tide,
    With the green trees waving overhead
        And a white corse laid beside.
                Margret, Margret.

    XXVI.

      A knight's bloodhound and he
        The funeral watch did keep;
    With a thought o' the chase he stroked its face
        As it howled to see him weep.
      A fair child kissed the dead,
        But shrank before its cold.
    And alone yet proudly in his hall
        Did stand a baron old.
                Margret, Margret.

    XXVII.

      Hang up my harp again!
        I have no voice for song.
    Not song but wail, and mourners pale,
        Not bards, to love belong.
      O failing human love!
        O light, by darkness known!
    O false, the while thou treadest earth!
        O deaf beneath the stone!
                Margret, Margret.




ISOBEL'S CHILD.

          ----so find we profit,
    By losing of our prayers.

    SHAKESPEARE.


    I.

    To rest the weary nurse has gone:
      An eight-day watch had watchèd she,
    Still rocking beneath sun and moon
      The baby on her knee,
    Till Isobel its mother said
    "The fever waneth--wend to bed,
      For now the watch comes round to me."

    II.

      Then wearily the nurse did throw
        Her pallet in the darkest place
    Of that sick room, and slept and dreamed:
      For, as the gusty wind did blow
        The night-lamp's flare across her face,
    She saw or seemed to see, but dreamed,
      That the poplars tall on the opposite hill,
    The seven tall poplars on the hill,
    Did clasp the setting sun until
    His rays dropped from him, pined and still
      As blossoms in frost,
    Till he waned and paled, so weirdly crossed,
    To the colour of moonlight which doth pass
    Over the dank ridged churchyard grass.
    The poplars held the sun, and he
    The eyes of the nurse that they should not see
    --Not for a moment, the babe on her knee,
    Though she shuddered to feel that it grew to be
    Too chill, and lay too heavily.

    III.

    She only dreamed; for all the while
      'T was Lady Isobel that kept
      The little baby: and it slept
    Fast, warm, as if its mother's smile,
    Laden with love's dewy weight,
    And red as rose of Harpocrate
    Dropt upon its eyelids, pressed
    Lashes to cheek in a sealèd rest.

    IV.

    And more and more smiled Isobel
    To see the baby sleep so well--
    She knew not that she smiled.
    Against the lattice, dull and wild
    Drive the heavy droning drops,
      Drop by drop, the sound being one;
    As momently time's segments fall
    On the ear of God, who hears through all
      Eternity's unbroken monotone:
    And more and more smiled Isobel
    To see the baby sleep so well--
    She knew not that she smiled.
    The wind in intermission stops
      Down in the beechen forest,
        Then cries aloud
      As one at the sorest,
        Self-stung, self-driven,
    And rises up to its very tops,
    Stiffening erect the branches bowed,
      Dilating with a tempest-soul
    The trees that with their dark hands break
    Through their own outline, and heavy roll
      Shadows as massive as clouds in heaven
        Across the castle lake
    And more and more smiled Isobel
    To see the baby sleep so well;
    She knew not that she smiled;
    She knew not that the storm was wild;
    Through the uproar drear she could not hear
    The castle clock which struck anear--
    She heard the low, light breathing of her child.

    V.

    O sight for wondering look!
    While the external nature broke
    Into such abandonment,
    While the very mist, heart-rent
    By the lightning, seemed to eddy
    Against nature, with a din,--
    A sense of silence and of steady
    Natural calm appeared to come
    From things without, and enter in
    The human creature's room.

    VI.

    So motionless she sate,
      The babe asleep upon her knees,
    You might have dreamed their souls had gone
    Away to things inanimate,
    In such to live, in such to moan;
    And that their bodies had ta'en back,
      In mystic change, all silences
    That cross the sky in cloudy rack,
    Or dwell beneath the reedy ground
    In waters safe from their own sound:
        Only she wore
    The deepening smile I named before,
    And that a deepening love expressed;
    And who at once can love and rest?

    VII.

    In sooth the smile that then was keeping
    Watch upon the baby sleeping,
      Floated with its tender light
    Downward, from the drooping eyes,
    Upward, from the lips apart,
      Over cheeks which had grown white
    With an eight-day weeping:
    All smiles come in such a wise
      Where tears shall fall or have of old--
    Like northern lights that fill the heart
      Of heaven in sign of cold.

    VIII.

    Motionless she sate.
    Her hair had fallen by its weight
    On each side of her smile and lay
    Very blackly on the arm
    Where the baby nestled warm,
    Pale as baby carved in stone
    Seen by glimpses of the moon
      Up a dark cathedral aisle:
    But, through the storm, no moonbeam fell
    Upon the child of Isobel--
    Perhaps you saw it by the ray
      Alone of her still smile.

    IX.

          A solemn thing it is to me
            To look upon a babe that sleeps
            Wearing in its spirit-deeps
          The undeveloped mystery
            Of our Adam's taint and woe,
          Which, when they developed be,
            Will not let it slumber so;
          Lying new in life beneath
          The shadow of the coming death,
          With that soft, low, quiet breath,
            As if it felt the sun;
          Knowing all things by their blooms,
          Not their roots, yea, sun and sky
          Only by the warmth that comes
          Out of each, earth only by
            The pleasant hues that o'er it run,
          And human love by drops of sweet
            White nourishment still hanging round
            The little mouth so slumber-bound:
          All which broken sentiency
          And conclusion incomplete,
            Will gather and unite and climb
          To an immortality
            Good or evil, each sublime,
          Through life and death to life again.
            O little lids, now folded fast,
            Must ye learn to drop at last
              Our large and burning tears?
          O warm quick body, must thou lie,
          When the time comes round to die,
              Still from all the whirl of years,
          Bare of all the joy and pain?
          O small frail being, wilt thou stand
          At God's right hand,
          Lifting up those sleeping eyes
          Dilated by great destinies,
    To an endless waking? thrones and seraphim.
    Through the long ranks of their solemnities,
    Sunning thee with calm looks of Heaven's surprise,
          But thine alone on Him?
    Or else, self-willed, to tread the Godless place,
    (God keep thy will!) feel thine own energies
    Cold, strong, objèctless, like a dead man's clasp,
    The sleepless deathless life within thee grasp,--
    While myriad faces, like one changeless face,
    With woe not love's, shall glass thee everywhere
    And overcome thee with thine own despair?

    X.

    More soft, less solemn images
    Drifted o'er the lady's heart
      Silently as snow.
    She had seen eight days depart
    Hour by hour, on bended knees,
      With pale-wrung hands and prayings low
    And broken, through which came the sound
    Of tears that fell against the ground,
    Making sad stops.--"Dear Lord, dear Lord!"
    She still had prayed, (the heavenly word
    Broken by an earthly sigh)
    --"Thou who didst not erst deny
    The mother-joy to Mary mild,
    Blessèd in the blessèd child
    Which hearkened in meek babyhood
    Her cradle-hymn, albeit used
    To all that music interfused
    In breasts of angels high and good!
    Oh, take not, Lord, my babe away--
    Oh, take not to thy songful heaven
    The pretty baby thou hast given,
    Or ere that I have seen him play
    Around his father's knees and known
    That he knew how my love has gone
    From all the world to him.
    Think, God among the cherubim,
    How I shall shiver every day
    In thy June sunshine, knowing where
    The grave-grass keeps it from his fair
    Still cheeks: and feel, at every tread,
    His little body, which is dead
    And hidden in thy turfy fold,
    Doth make thy whole warm earth a-cold!
    O God, I am so young, so young--
      I am not used to tears at nights
    Instead of slumber--not to prayer
    With sobbing lips and hands out-wrung!
    Thou knowest all my prayings were
      'I bless thee, God, for past delights--
    Thank God!' I am not used to bear
    Hard thoughts of death; the earth doth cover
    No face from me of friend or lover:
    And must the first who teaches me
    The form of shrouds and funerals, be
    Mine own first-born belovèd? he
    Who taught me first this mother-love?
    Dear Lord who spreadest out above
    Thy loving, transpierced hands to meet
    All lifted hearts with blessing sweet,--
    Pierce not my heart, my tender heart
    Thou madest tender! Thou who art
    So happy in thy heaven alway,
    Take not mine only bliss away!"

    XI.

    She so had prayed: and God, who hears
    Through seraph-songs the sound of tears
    From that belovèd babe had ta'en
    The fever and the beating pain.
    And more and more smiled Isobel
    To see the baby sleep so well,
      (She knew not that she smiled, I wis)
    Until the pleasant gradual thought
    Which near her heart the smile enwrought,
    Now soft and slow, itself did seem
    To float along a happy dream,
      Beyond it into speech like this.

    XII.

    "I prayed for thee, my little child,
      And God has heard my prayer!
    And when thy babyhood is gone,
    We two together undefiled
    By men's repinings, will kneel down
      Upon His earth which will be fair
    (Not covering thee, sweet!) to us twain,
      And give Him thankful praise."

    XIII.

    Dully and wildly drives the rain:
    Against the lattices drives the rain.

    XIV.

    "I thank Him now, that I can think
      Of those same future days,
    Nor from the harmless image shrink
      Of what I there might see--
    Strange babies on their mothers' knee,
    Whose innocent soft faces might
    From off mine eyelids strike the light,
      With looks not meant for me!"

    XV.

    Gustily blows the wind through the rain,
    As against the lattices drives the rain.

    XVI.

    "But now, O baby mine, together,
      We turn this hope of ours again
    To many an hour of summer weather,
    When we shall sit and intertwine
      Our spirits, and instruct each other
      In the pure loves of child and mother!
    Two human loves make one divine."

    XVII.

    The thunder tears through the wind and the rain,
    As full on the lattices drives the rain.

    XVIII.

    "My little child, what wilt thou choose?
      Now let me look at thee and ponder.
    What gladness, from the gladnesses
      Futurity is spreading under
    Thy gladsome sight? Beneath the trees
    Wilt thou lean all day, and lose
    Thy spirit with the river seen
    Intermittently between
      The winding beechen alleys,--
    Half in labour, half repose,
      Like a shepherd keeping sheep,
      Thou, with only thoughts to keep
    Which never a bound will overpass,
    And which are innocent as those
      That feed among Arcadian valleys
          Upon the dewy grass?"

    XIX.

    The large white owl that with age is blind,
      That hath sate for years in the old tree hollow,
    Is carried away in a gust of wind;
    His wings could beat him not as fast
    As he goeth now the lattice past;
      He is borne by the winds, the rains do follow
    His white wings to the blast outflowing,
        He hooteth in going,
    And still, in the lightnings, coldly glitter
        His round unblinking eyes

    XX.

    "Or, baby, wilt thou think it fitter
      To be eloquent and wise,
    One upon whose lips the air
      Turns to solemn verities
    For men to breathe anew, and win
    A deeper-seated life within?
    Wilt be a philosopher,
      By whose voice the earth and skies
    Shall speak to the unborn?
    Or a poet, broadly spreading
      The golden immortalities
    Of thy soul on natures lorn
      And poor of such, them all to guard
    From their decay,--beneath thy treading,
    Earth's flowers recovering hues of Eden,--
    And stars, drawn downward by thy looks,
    To shine ascendant in thy books?"

    XXI.

      The tame hawk in the castle-yard,
    How it screams to the lightning, with its wet
    Jagged plumes overhanging the parapet!
    And at the lady's door the hound
    Scratches with a crying sound.

    XXII.

    "But, O my babe, thy lids are laid
      Close, fast upon thy cheek,
    And not a dream of power and sheen
    Can make a passage up between;
    Thy heart is of thy mother's made,
      Thy looks are very meek,
    And it will be their chosen place
    To rest on some beloved face,
      As these on thine, and let the noise
    Of the whole world go on nor drown
      The tender silence of thy joys:
    Or when that silence shall have grown
      Too tender for itself, the same
    Yearning for sound,--to look above
    And utter its one meaning, LOVE,
      That He may hear His name."

    XXIII.

    No wind, no rain, no thunder!
    The waters had trickled not slowly,
    The thunder was not spent
    Nor the wind near finishing;
    Who would have said that the storm was diminishing?
    No wind, no rain, no thunder!
    Their noises dropped asunder
    From the earth and the firmament,
    From the towers and the lattices,
    Abrupt and echoless
    As ripe fruits on the ground unshaken wholly
        As life in death.
    And sudden and solemn the silence fell,
    Startling the heart of Isobel
      As the tempest could not:
    Against the door went panting the breath
    Of the lady's hound whose cry was still,
      And she, constrained howe'er she would not,
    Lifted her eyes and saw the moon
    Looking out of heaven alone
      Upon the poplared hill,--
      A calm of God, made visible
      That men might bless it at their will.

    XXIV.

    The moonshine on the baby's face
      Falleth clear and cold:
    The mother's looks have fallen back
      To the same place:
    Because no moon with silver rack,
    Nor broad sunrise in jasper skies
        Has power to hold
        Our loving eyes,
    Which still revert, as ever must
    Wonder and Hope, to gaze on the dust.

    XXV.

    The moonshine on the baby's face
      Cold and clear remaineth;
    The mother's looks do shrink away,--
    The mother's looks return to stay,
      As charmèd by what paineth:
    Is any glamour in the case?
      Is it dream, or is it sight?
    Hath the change upon the wild
      Elements that sign the night,
    Passed upon the child?
      It is not dream, but sight.

    XXVI.

    The babe has awakened from sleep
      And unto the gaze of its mother,
      Bent over it, lifted another--
      Not the baby-looks that go
      Unaimingly to and fro,
    But an earnest gazing deep
    Such as soul gives soul at length
      When by work and wail of years
    It winneth a solemn strength
      And mourneth as it wears.
    A strong man could not brook,
      With pulse unhurried by fears,
    To meet that baby's look
      O'erglazed by manhood's tears,
    The tears of a man full grown,
    With a power to wring our own,
    In the eyes all undefiled
    Of a little three-months' child--
    To see that babe-brow wrought
    By the witnessing of thought
      To judgment's prodigy,
    And the small soft mouth unweaned,
    By mother's kiss o'erleaned,
    (Putting the sound of loving
    Where no sound else was moving
      Except the speechless cry)
    Quickened to mind's expression,
    Shaped to articulation,
    Yea, uttering words, yea, naming woe,
      In tones that with it strangely went
      Because so baby-innocent,
    As the child spake out to the mother, so:--

    XXVII.

    "O mother, mother, loose thy prayer!
      Christ's name hath made it strong.
    It bindeth me, it holdeth me
    With its most loving cruelty,
      From floating my new soul along
      The happy heavenly air.
    It bindeth me, it holdeth me
      In all this dark, upon this dull
    Low earth, by only weepers trod.
    It bindeth me, it holdeth me!
      Mine angel looketh sorrowful
    Upon the face of God.[1]

    XXVIII.

    "Mother, mother, can I dream
      Beneath your earthly trees?
    I had a vision and a gleam,
      I heard a sound more sweet than these
    When rippled by the wind:
      Did you see the Dove with wings
      Bathed in golden glisterings
    From a sunless light behind,
      Dropping on me from the sky,
    Soft as mother's kiss, until
    I seemed to leap and yet was still?
      Saw you how His love-large eye
    Looked upon me mystic calms,
      Till the power of His divine
      Vision was indrawn to mine?

    XXIX.

    "Oh, the dream within the dream!
      I saw celestial places even.
    Oh, the vistas of high palms
      Making finites of delight
      Through the heavenly infinite,
    Lifting up their green still tops
      To the heaven of heaven!
    Oh, the sweet life-tree that drops
    Shade like light across the river
    Glorified in its for-ever
      Flowing from the Throne!
    Oh, the shining holinesses
    Of the thousand, thousand faces
      God-sunned by the thronèd ONE,
    And made intense with such a love
    That, though I saw them turned above,
    Each loving seemed for also me!
    And, oh, the Unspeakable, the HE,
    The manifest in secrecies
      Yet of mine own heart partaker
    With the overcoming look
    Of One who hath been once forsook
      And blesseth the forsaker!
    Mother, mother, let me go
    Toward the Face that looketh so!
      Through the mystic wingèd Four
    Whose are inward, outward eyes
    Dark with light of mysteries
      And the restless evermore
    'Holy, holy, holy,'--through
    The sevenfold Lamps that burn in view
      Of cherubim and seraphim,--
    Through the four-and-twenty crowned
    Stately elders white around,
      Suffer me to go to Him!

    XXX.

    "Is your wisdom very wise,
      Mother, on the narrow earth,
      Very happy, very worth
    That I should stay to learn?
    Are these air-corrupting sighs
      Fashioned by unlearnèd breath?
    Do the students' lamps that burn
      All night, illumine death?
    Mother, albeit this be so,
    Loose thy prayer and let me go
    Where that bright chief angel stands
    Apart from all his brother bands,
    Too glad for smiling, having bent
    In angelic wilderment
    O'er the depths of God, and brought
    Reeling thence one only thought
    To fill his own eternity.
    He the teacher is for me--
    He can teach what I would know--
    Mother, mother, let me go!

    XXXI.

    "Can your poet make an Eden
      No winter will undo,
    And light a starry fire while heeding
      His hearth's is burning too?
    Drown in music the earth's din,
    And keep his own wild soul within
      The law of his own harmony?
    Mother, albeit this be so,
    Let me to my heaven go!
      A little harp me waits thereby,
    A harp whose strings are golden all
    And tuned to music spherical,
    Hanging on the green life-tree
    Where no willows ever be.
    Shall I miss that harp of mine?
    Mother, no!--the Eye divine
    Turned upon it, makes it shine;
    And when I touch it, poems sweet
    Like separate souls shall fly from it,
    Each to the immortal fytte.
    We shall all be poets there,
    Gazing on the chiefest Fair.

    XXXII.

    "Love! earth's love! and can we love
    Fixedly where all things move?
    Can the sinning love each other?
      Mother, mother,
    I tremble in thy close embrace,
    I feel thy tears adown my face,
      Thy prayers do keep me out of bliss--
    O dreary earthly love!
    Loose thy prayer and let me go
      To the place which loving is
    Yet not sad; and when is given
    Escape to thee from this below,
    Thou shalt behold me that I wait
    For thee beside the happy Gate,
    And silence shall be up in heaven
      To hear our greeting kiss."

    XXXIII.

      The nurse awakes in the morning sun,
        And starts to see beside her bed
        The lady with a grandeur spread
      Like pathos o'er her face, as one
      God-satisfied and earth-undone;
        The babe upon her arm was dead:
    And the nurse could utter forth no cry,--
    She was awed by the calm in the mother's eye.

    XXXIV.

    "Wake, nurse!" the lady said;
      "We are waking--he and I--
      I, on earth, and he, in sky:
    And thou must help me to o'erlay
    With garment white this little clay
      Which needs no more our lullaby.

    XXXV.

    "I changed the cruel prayer I made,
    And bowed my meekened face, and prayed
    That God would do His will; and thus
    He did it, nurse! He parted us:
    And His sun shows victorious
    The dead calm face,--and I am calm,
    And Heaven is hearkening a new psalm.

    XXXVI.

    "This earthly noise is too anear,
    Too loud, and will not let me hear
    The little harp. My death will soon
    Make silence."

                  And a sense of tune,
    A satisfied love meanwhile
    Which nothing earthly could despoil,
    Sang on within her soul.

    XXXVII.

                             Oh you,
    Earth's tender and impassioned few,
    Take courage to entrust your love
    To Him so named who guards above
      Its ends and shall fulfil!
    Breaking the narrow prayers that may
    Befit your narrow hearts, away
      In His broad, loving will.


THE ROMAUNT OF THE PAGE.


    I.

    A knight of gallant deeds
      And a young page at his side,
    From the holy war in Palestine
      Did slow and thoughtful ride,
    As each were a palmer and told for beads
      The dews of the eventide.

    II.

    "O young page," said the knight,
      "A noble page art thou!
    Thou fearest not to steep in blood
      The curls upon thy brow;
    And once in the tent, and twice in the fight,
      Didst ward me a mortal blow."

    III.

    "O brave knight," said the page,
      "Or ere we hither came,
    We talked in tent, we talked in field,
      Of the bloody battle-game;
    But here, below this greenwood bough,
      I cannot speak the same.

    IV.

    "Our troop is far behind,
      The woodland calm is new;
    Our steeds, with slow grass-muffled hoofs,
      Tread deep the shadows through;
    And, in my mind, some blessing kind
      Is dropping with the dew.

    V.

    "The woodland calm is pure--
      I cannot choose but have
    A thought from these, o' the beechen-trees,
      Which in our England wave,
    And of the little finches fine
    Which sang there while in Palestine
      The warrior-hilt we drave.

    VI.

    "Methinks, a moment gone,
      I heard my mother pray!
    I heard, sir knight, the prayer for me
      Wherein she passed away;
    And I know the heavens are leaning down
      To hear what I shall say."

    VII.

    The page spake calm and high,
      As of no mean degree;
    Perhaps he felt in nature's broad
      Full heart, his own was free:
    And the knight looked up to his lifted eye,
      Then answered smilingly--

    VIII.

    "Sir page, I pray your grace!
      Certes, I meant not so
    To cross your pastoral mood, sir page,
      With the crook of the battle-bow;
    But a knight may speak of a lady's face,
    I ween, in any mood or place,
      If the grasses die or grow.

    IX.

    "And this I meant to say--
      My lady's face shall shine
    As ladies' faces use, to greet
      My page from Palestine;
    Or, speak she fair or prank she gay,
      She is no lady of mine.

    X.

    "And this I meant to fear--
      Her bower may suit thee ill;
    For, sooth, in that same field and tent,
      Thy talk was somewhat still:
    And fitter thy hand for my knightly spear
      Than thy tongue for my lady's will!"

    XI.

    Slowly and thankfully
      The young page bowed his head;
    His large eyes seemed to muse a smile,
      Until he blushed instead,
    And no lady in her bower, pardiè,
      Could blush more sudden red:
    "Sir Knight,--thy lady's bower to me
      Is suited well," he said.

    XII.

            Beati, beati, mortui!
            From the convent on the sea,
            One mile off, or scarce so nigh,
            Swells the dirge as clear and high
            As if that, over brake and lea,
            Bodily the wind did carry
            The great altar of Saint Mary,
            And the fifty tapers burning o'er it,
            And the lady Abbess dead before it,
            And the chanting nuns whom yesterweek
            Her voice did charge and bless,--
            Chanting steady, chanting meek,
            Chanting with a solemn breath,
            Because that they are thinking less
            Upon the dead than upon death.
            Beati, beati, mortui!
            Now the vision in the sound
            Wheeleth on the wind around;
            Now it sweepeth back, away--
            The uplands will not let it stay
            To dark the western sun:
            Mortui!--away at last,--
            Or ere the page's blush is past!
    And the knight heard all, and the page heard none.

    XIII.

            "A boon, thou noble knight,
              If ever I servèd thee!
    Though thou art a knight and I am a page,
              Now grant a boon to me;
    And tell me sooth, if dark or bright,
    If little loved or loved aright
      Be the face of thy ladye."

    XIV.

    Gloomily looked the knight--
      "As a son thou hast servèd me,
    And would to none I had granted boon
      Except to only thee!
    For haply then I should love aright,
    For then I should know if dark or bright
      Were the face of my ladye.

    XV.

    "Yet it ill suits my knightly tongue
      To grudge that granted boon,
    That heavy price from heart and life
      I paid in silence down;
    The hand that claimed it, cleared in fine
    My father's fame: I swear by mine,
      That price was nobly won!

    XVI.

    "Earl Walter was a brave old earl,
      He was my father's friend,
    And while I rode the lists at court
      And little guessed the end,
    My noble father in his shroud
    Against a slanderer lying loud,
      He rose up to defend.

    XVII.

    "Oh, calm below the marble grey
      My father's dust was strown!
    Oh, meek above the marble grey
      His image prayed alone!
    The slanderer lied: the wretch was brave--
    For, looking up the minster-nave,
    He saw my father's knightly glaive
      Was changed from steel to stone.

    XVIII.

    "Earl Walter's glaive was steel,
      With a brave old hand to wear it,
    And dashed the lie back in the mouth
    Which lied against the godly truth
      And against the knightly merit
    The slanderer, 'neath the avenger's heel,
    Struck up the dagger in appeal
    From stealthy lie to brutal force--
    And out upon the traitor's corse
      Was yielded the true spirit.

    XIX.

    "I would mine hand had fought that fight
      And justified my father!
    I would mine heart had caught that wound
      And slept beside him rather!
    I think it were a better thing
    Than murdered friend and marriage-ring
      Forced on my life together.

    XX.

    "Wail shook Earl Walter's house;
      His true wife shed no tear;
    She lay upon her bed as mute
      As the earl did on his bier:
    Till--'Ride, ride fast,' she said at last,
      'And bring the avengèd's son anear!
    Ride fast, ride free, as a dart can flee,
    For white of blee with waiting for me
      Is the corse in the next chambère.'

    XXI.

    "I came, I knelt beside her bed;
      Her calm was worse than strife:
    'My husband, for thy father dear,
    Gave freely when thou wast not here
      His own and eke my life.
    A boon! Of that sweet child we make
    An orphan for thy father's sake,
      Make thou, for ours, a wife.'

    XXII.

    "I said, 'My steed neighs in the court,
      My bark rocks on the brine,
    And the warrior's vow I am under now
      To free the pilgrim's shrine;
    But fetch the ring and fetch the priest
      And call that daughter of thine,
    And rule she wide from my castle on Nyde
      While I am in Palestine.'

    XXIII.

    "In the dark chambère, if the bride was fair,
      Ye wis, I could not see,
    But the steed thrice neighed, and the priest fast prayed,
      And wedded fast were we.
    Her mother smiled upon her bed
    As at its side we knelt to wed,
      And the bride rose from her knee
    And kissed the smile of her mother dead,
      Or ever she kissed me.

    XXIV.

    "My page, my page, what grieves thee so,
      That the tears run down thy face?"--
    "Alas, alas! mine own sistèr
      Was in thy lady's case:
    But she laid down the silks she wore
    And followed him she wed before,
    Disguised as his true servitor,
      To the very battle-place."

    XXV.

    And wept the page, but laughed the knight,
      A careless laugh laughed he:
    "Well done it were for thy sistèr,
      But not for my ladye!
    My love, so please you, shall requite
    No woman, whether dark or bright,
      Unwomaned if she be."

    XXVI.

    The page stopped weeping and smiled cold--
      "Your wisdom may declare
    That womanhood is proved the best
    By golden brooch and glossy vest
      The mincing ladies wear;
    Yet is it proved, and was of old,
    Anear as well, I dare to hold,
      By truth, or by despair."

    XXVII.

    He smiled no more, he wept no more,
      But passionate he spake--
    "Oh, womanly she prayed in tent,
      When none beside did wake!
    Oh, womanly she paled in fight,
      For one belovèd's sake!--
    And her little hand, defiled with blood,
    Her tender tears of womanhood
      Most woman-pure did make!"

    XXVIII.

    --"Well done it were for thy sistèr,
      Thou tellest well her tale!
    But for my lady, she shall pray
      I' the kirk of Nydesdale.
    Not dread for me but love for me
      Shall make my lady pale;
    No casque shall hide her woman's tear--
    It shall have room to trickle clear
      Behind her woman's veil."

    XXIX.

    --"But what if she mistook thy mind
      And followed thee to strife,
    Then kneeling did entreat thy love
      As Paynims ask for life?"
    --"I would forgive, and evermore
    Would love her as my servitor,
      But little as my wife.

    XXX.

    "Look up--there is a small bright cloud
      Alone amid the skies!
    So high, so pure, and so apart,
      A woman's honour lies."
    The page looked up--the cloud was sheen--
    A sadder cloud did rush, I ween,
      Betwixt it and his eyes.

    XXXI.

    Then dimly dropped his eyes away
      From welkin unto hill--
    Ha! who rides there?--the page is 'ware,
      Though the cry at his heart is still:
    And the page seeth all and the knight seeth none,
    Though banner and spear do fleck the sun,
      And the Saracens ride at will.

    XXXII.

    He speaketh calm, he speaketh low,--
      "Ride fast, my master, ride,
    Or ere within the broadening dark
      The narrow shadows hide."
    "Yea, fast, my page, I will do so,
      And keep thou at my side."

    XXXIII.

    "Now nay, now nay, ride on thy way,
      Thy faithful page precede.
    For I must loose on saddle-bow
    My battle-casque that galls, I trow,
      The shoulder of my steed;
    And I must pray, as I did vow,
      For one in bitter need.

    XXXIV.

    "Ere night I shall be near to thee,--
      Now ride, my master, ride!
    Ere night, as parted spirits cleave
    To mortals too beloved to leave,
      I shall be at thy side."
    The knight smiled free at the fantasy,
      And adown the dell did ride.

    XXXV.

    Had the knight looked up to the page's face,
      No smile the word had won;
    Had the knight looked up to the page's face,
      I ween he had never gone:
    Had the knight looked back to the page's geste,
      I ween he had turned anon,
    For dread was the woe in the face so young,
    And wild was the silent geste that flung
    Casque, sword to earth, as the boy down-sprung
      And stood--alone, alone.

    XXXVI.

    He clenched his hands as if to hold
      His soul's great agony--
    "Have I renounced my womanhood,
      For wifehood unto thee,
    And is this the last, last look of thine
      That ever I shall see?

    XXXVII.

    "Yet God thee save, and mayst thou have
      A lady to thy mind,
    More woman-proud and half as true
      As one thou leav'st behind!
    And God me take with HIM to dwell--
    For HIM I cannot love too well,
      As I have loved my kind."

    XXXVIII.

    She looketh up, in earth's despair,
      The hopeful heavens to seek;
    That little cloud still floateth there,
      Whereof her loved did speak:
    How bright the little cloud appears!
    Her eyelids fall upon the tears,
      And the tears down either cheek.

    XXXIX.

    The tramp of hoof, the flash of steel--
      The Paynims round her coming!
    The sound and sight have made her calm,--
      False page, but truthful woman;
    She stands amid them all unmoved:
    A heart once broken by the loved
      Is strong to meet the foeman.

    XL.

    "Ho, Christian page! art keeping sheep,
      From pouring wine-cups resting?"--
    "I keep my master's noble name,
      For warring, not for feasting;
    And if that here Sir Hubert were,
    My master brave, my master dear,
      Ye would not stay the questing."

    XLI.

    "Where is thy master, scornful page,
      That we may slay or bind him?"--
    "Now search the lea and search the wood,
      And see if ye can find him!
    Nathless, as hath been often tried,
    Your Paynim heroes faster ride
      Before him than behind him."

    XLII.

    "Give smoother answers, lying page,
      Or perish in the lying!"--
    "I trow that if the warrior brand
    Beside my foot, were in my hand,
      'T were better at replying!"
    They cursed her deep, they smote her low,
    They cleft her golden ringlets through;
      The Loving is the Dying.

    XLIII.

    She felt the scimitar gleam down,
      And met it from beneath
    With smile more bright in victory
      Than any sword from sheath,--
    Which flashed across her lip serene,
    Most like the spirit-light between
      The darks of life and death.

    XLIV.

      Ingemisco, ingemisco!
    From the convent on the sea,
    Now it sweepeth solemnly,
    As over wood and over lea
    Bodily the wind did carry
    The great altar of St. Mary,
    And the fifty tapers paling o'er it,
    And the Lady Abbess stark before it,
    And the weary nuns with hearts that faintly
    Beat along their voices saintly--
      Ingemisco, ingemisco!
    Dirge for abbess laid in shroud
    Sweepeth o'er the shroudless dead,
    Page or lady, as we said,
    With the dews upon her head,
    All as sad if not as loud.
      Ingemisco, ingemisco!
    Is ever a lament begun
    By any mourner under sun,
    Which, ere it endeth, suits but one?




THE LAY OF THE BROWN ROSARY.


FIRST PART.


    I.

    "Onora, Onora,"--her mother is calling,
    She sits at the lattice and hears the dew falling
    Drop after drop from the sycamores laden
    With dew as with blossom, and calls home the maiden,
          "Night cometh, Onora."

    II.

    She looks down the garden-walk caverned with trees,
    To the limes at the end where the green arbour is--
    "Some sweet thought or other may keep where it found her,
    While, forgot or unseen in the dreamlight around her,
          Night cometh--Onora!"

    III.

    She looks up the forest whose alleys shoot on
    Like the mute minster-aisles when the anthem is done
    And the choristers sitting with faces aslant
    Feel the silence to consecrate more than the chant--
          "Onora, Onora!"

    IV.

    And forward she looketh across the brown heath--
    "Onora, art coming?"--what is it she seeth?
    Nought, nought but the grey border-stone that is wist
    To dilate and assume a wild shape in the mist--
          "My daughter!" Then over

    V.

    The casement she leaneth, and as she doth so
    She is 'ware of her little son playing below:
    "Now where is Onora?" He hung down his head
    And spake not, then answering blushed scarlet-red,--
          "At the tryst with her lover."

    VI.

    But his mother was wroth: in a sternness quoth she,
    "As thou play'st at the ball art thou playing with me?
    When we know that her lover to battle is gone,
    And the saints know above that she loveth but one
          And will ne'er wed another?"

    VII.

    Then the boy wept aloud; 't was a fair sight yet sad
    To see the tears run down the sweet blooms he had:
    He stamped with his foot, said--"The saints know I lied
    Because truth that is wicked is fittest to hide:
          Must I utter it, mother?"

    VIII.

    In his vehement childhood he hurried within
    And knelt at her feet as in prayer against sin,
    But a child at a prayer never sobbeth as he--
    "Oh! she sits with the nun of the brown rosary,
          At nights in the ruin--

    IX.

    "The old convent ruin the ivy rots off,
    Where the owl hoots by day and the toad is sun-proof,
    Where no singing-birds build and the trees gaunt and grey
    As in stormy sea-coasts appear blasted one way--
          But is this the wind's doing?

    X.

    "A nun in the east wall was buried alive
    Who mocked at the priest when he called her to shrive,
    And shrieked such a curse, as the stone took her breath,
    The old abbess fell backwards and swooned unto death
          With an Ave half-spoken.

    XI.

    "I tried once to pass it, myself and my hound,
    Till, as fearing the lash, down he shivered to ground--
    A brave hound, my mother! a brave hound, ye wot!
    And the wolf thought the same with his fangs at her throat
          In the pass of the Brocken.

    XII.

    "At dawn and at eve, mother, who sitteth there
    With the brown rosary never used for a prayer?
    Stoop low, mother, low! If we went there to see,
    What an ugly great hole in that east wall must be
          At dawn and at even!

    XIII.

    "Who meet there, my mother, at dawn and at even?
    Who meet by that wall, never looking to heaven?
    O sweetest my sister, what doeth with thee
    The ghost of a nun with a brown rosary
          And a face turned from heaven?

    XIV.

    "Saint Agnes o'erwatcheth my dreams and erewhile
    I have felt through mine eyelids the warmth of her smile;
    But last night, as a sadness like pity came o'er her,
    She whispered--'Say two prayers at dawn for Onora:
          The Tempted is sinning.'"

    XV.

    "Onora, Onora!" they heard her not coming,
    Not a step on the grass, not a voice through the gloaming;
    But her mother looked up, and she stood on the floor
    Fair and still as the moonlight that came there before,
          And a smile just beginning:

    XVI.

    It touches her lips but it dares not arise
    To the height of the mystical sphere of her eyes,
    And the large musing eyes, neither joyous nor sorry
    Sing on like the angels in separate glory
          Between clouds of amber;

    XVII.

    For the hair droops in clouds amber-coloured till stirred
    Into gold by the gesture that comes with a word;
    While--O soft!--her speaking is so interwound
    Of the dim and the sweet, 't is a twilight of sound
          And floats through the chamber.

    XVIII.

    "Since thou shrivest my brother, fair mother," said she
    "I count on thy priesthood for marrying of me,
    And I know by the hills that the battle is done.
    That my lover rides on, will be here with the sun,
          'Neath the eyes that behold thee."

    XIX.

    Her mother sat silent--too tender, I wis,
    Of the smile her dead father smiled dying to kiss:
    But the boy started up pale with tears, passion-wrought--
    "O wicked fair sister, the hills utter nought!
          If he cometh, who told thee?"

    XX.

    "I know by the hills," she resumed calm and clear,
    "By the beauty upon them, that HE is anear:
    Did they ever look so since he bade me adieu?
    Oh, love in the waking, sweet brother, is true,
          As Saint Agnes in sleeping!"

    XXI.

    Half-ashamed and half-softened the boy did not speak,
    And the blush met the lashes which fell on his cheek:
    She bowed down to kiss him: dear saints, did he see
    Or feel on her bosom the BROWN ROSARY,
          That he shrank away weeping?


SECOND PART.

A bed. ONORA, sleeping. Angels, but not near.


First Angel.

    Must we stand so far, and she
    So very fair?

Second Angel.

            As bodies be.

First Angel.

    And she so mild?

Second Angel.

                    As spirits when
    They meeken, not to God, but men.

First Angel.

    And she so young, that I who bring
      Good dreams for saintly children, might
      Mistake that small soft face to-night,
    And fetch her such a blessèd thing
  That at her waking she would weep
    For childhood lost anew in sleep.
    How hath she sinned?

Second Angel.

                      In bartering love;
    God's love for man's.

First Angel.

                           We may reprove
    The world for this, not only her:
    Let me approach to breathe away
    This dust o' the heart with holy air.

Second Angel.

    Stand off! She sleeps, and did not pray.

First Angel.

    Did none pray for her?

Second Angel.

                           Ay, a child,--
    Who never, praying, wept before:
    While, in a mother undefiled,
    Prayer goeth on in sleep, as true
    And pauseless as the pulses do.

First Angel.

    Then I approach.

Second Angel.

                       It is not WILLED.

First Angel.

    One word: is she redeemed?

Second Angel.

                                No more!
    The place is filled.            [Angels vanish

Evil Spirit (in a Nun's garb by the bed).

    Forbear that dream--forbear that dream! too near to heaven it leaned.

Onora (in sleep).

    Nay, leave me this--but only this! 't is but a dream, sweet fiend!

Evil Spirit.

    It is a thought.

Onora (in sleep).

                    A sleeping thought--most innocent of good:
    It doth the Devil no harm, sweet fiend! it cannot if it would.
    I say in it no holy hymn, I do no holy work,
    I scarcely hear the sabbath-bell that chimeth from the kirk.

Evil Spirit.

    Forbear that dream--forbear that dream!

Onora (in sleep).

          Nay, let me dream at least.
    That far-off bell, it may be took for viol at a feast:
    I only walk among the fields, beneath the autumn-sun,
    With my dead father, hand in hand, as I have often done.

Evil Spirit.

    Forbear that dream--forbear that dream!

Onora (in sleep).

             Nay, sweet fiend, let me go:
    I never more can walk with him, oh, never more but so!
    For they have tied my father's feet beneath the kirk-yard stone,
    Oh, deep and straight! oh, very straight! they move at nights alone:
    And then he calleth through my dreams, he calleth tenderly,
    "Come forth, my daughter, my beloved, and walk the fields with me!"

Evil Spirit.

    Forbear that dream, or else disprove its pureness by a sign.

Onora (in sleep).

    Speak on, thou shalt be satisfied, my word shall answer thine.
    I heard a bird which used to sing when I a child was praying,
    I see the poppies in the corn I used to sport away in:
    What shall I do--tread down the dew and pull the blossoms blowing?
    Or clap my wicked hands to fright the finches from the rowan?

Evil Spirit.

    Thou shalt do something harder still. Stand up where thou dost stand
    Among the fields of Dreamland with thy father hand in hand,
    And clear and slow repeat the vow, declare its cause and kind,
    Which not to break, in sleep or wake thou bearest on thy mind.

Onora (in sleep).

    I bear a vow of sinful kind, a vow for mournful cause;
    I vowed it deep, I vowed it strong, the spirits laughed applause:
    The spirits trailed along the pines low laughter like a breeze,
    While, high atween their swinging tops, the stars appeared to freeze.

Evil Spirit.

    More calm and free, speak out to me why such a vow was made.

Onora (in sleep).

    Because that God decreed my death and I shrank back afraid.
    Have patience, O dead father mine! I did not fear to die--
    I wish I were a young dead child and had thy company!
    I wish I lay beside thy feet, a buried three-year child,
    And wearing only a kiss of thine upon my lips that smiled!
    The linden-tree that covers thee might so have shadowed twain,
    For death itself I did not fear--'t is love that makes the pain:
    Love feareth death. I was no child, I was betrothed that day;
    I wore a troth-kiss on my lips I could not give away.
    How could I bear to lie content and still beneath a stone,
    And feel mine own betrothed go by--alas! no more mine own--
    Go leading by in wedding pomp some lovely lady brave,
    With cheeks that blushed as red as rose, while mine were white in
        grave?
    How could I bear to sit in heaven, on e'er so high a throne,
    And hear him say to her--to her! that else he loveth none?
    Though e'er so high I sate above, though e'er so low he spake,
    As clear as thunder I should hear the new oath he might take,
    That hers, forsooth, were heavenly eyes--ah me, while very dim
    Some heavenly eyes (indeed of heaven!) would darken down to him!

Evil Spirit.

    Who told thee thou wast called to death?

Onora (in sleep).

                                      I sate all night beside thee:
    The grey owl on the ruined wall shut both his eyes to hide thee,
    And ever he flapped his heavy wing all brokenly and weak,
    And the long grass waved against the sky, around his gasping beak.
    I sate beside thee all the night, while the moonlight lay forlorn
    Strewn round us like a dead world's shroud in ghastly fragments torn:
    And through the night, and through the hush, and over the flapping
        wing,
    We heard beside the Heavenly Gate the angels murmuring:
    We heard them say, "Put day to day, and count the days to seven,
    And God will draw Onora up the golden stairs of heaven.
    And yet the Evil ones have leave that purpose to defer,
    For if she has no need of HIM, He has no need of her."

Evil Spirit.

    Speak out to me, speak bold and free.

Onora (in sleep).

                           And then I heard thee say--
    "I count upon my rosary brown the hours thou hast to stay!
    Yet God permits us Evil ones to put by that decree,
    Since if thou hast no need of HIM, He has no need of thee:
    And if thou wilt forgo the sight of angels, verily
    Thy true love gazing on thy face shall guess what angels be;
    Nor bride shall pass, save thee" ... Alas!--my father's hand's a-cold,
    The meadows seem ...

Evil Spirit.

                        Forbear the dream, or let the vow be told.

Onora (in sleep).

    I vowed upon thy rosary brown, this string of antique beads,
    By charnel lichens overgrown, and dank among the weeds,
    This rosary brown which is thine own,--lost soul of buried nun!
    Who, lost by vow, wouldst render now all souls alike undone,--
    I vowed upon thy rosary brown,--and, till such vow should break,
    A pledge always of living days 't was hung around my neck--
    I vowed to thee on rosary (dead father, look not so!),
    I would not thank God in my weal, nor seek God in my woe.

Evil Spirit.

    And canst thou prove ...

Onora (in sleep).

                          O love, my love! I felt him near again!
    I saw his steed on mountain-head, I heard it on the plain!
    Was this no weal for me to feel? Is greater weal than this?
    Yet when he came, I wept his name--and the angels heard but his.

Evil Spirit.

    Well done, well done!

Onora (in sleep).

            Ah me, the sun! the dreamlight 'gins to pine,--
    Ah me, how dread can look the Dead! Aroint thee, father mine!

    She starteth from slumber, she sitteth upright,
    And her breath comes in sobs, while she stares through the night;
    There is nought; the great willow, her lattice before,
    Large-drawn in the moon, lieth calm on the floor:
    But her hands tremble fast as their pulses and, free
    From the death-clasp, close over--the BROWN ROSARY.


THIRD PART.


    I.

    'Tis a morn for a bridal; the merry bride-bell
    Rings clear through the green-wood that skirts the chapelle,
    And the priest at the altar awaiteth the bride,
    And the sacristans slyly are jesting aside
            At the work shall be doing;

    II.

    While down through the wood rides that fair company,
    The youths with the courtship, the maids with the glee,
    Till the chapel-cross opens to sight, and at once
    All the maids sigh demurely and think for the nonce,
            "And so endeth a wooing!"

    III.

    And the bride and the bridegroom are leading the way,
    With his hand on her rein, and a word yet to say;
    Her dropt eyelids suggest the soft answers beneath,
    And the little quick smiles come and go with her breath
            When she sigheth or speaketh.

    IV.

    And the tender bride-mother breaks off unaware
    From an Ave, to think that her daughter is fair,
    Till in nearing the chapel and glancing before,
    She seeth her little son stand at the door:
            Is it play that he seeketh?

    V.

    Is it play, when his eyes wander innocent-wild
    And sublimed with a sadness unfitting a child?
    He trembles not, weeps not; the passion is done,
    And calmly he kneels in their midst, with the sun
            On his head like a glory.

    VI.

    "O fair-featured maids, ye are many!" he cried,
    "But in fairness and vileness who matcheth the bride?
    O brave-hearted youths, ye are many! but whom
    For the courage and woe can ye match with the groom
            As ye see them before ye?"

    VII.

    Out spake the bride's mother, "The vileness is thine
    If thou shame thine own sister, a bride at the shrine!"
    Out spake the bride's lover, "The vileness be mine
    If he shame mine own wife at the hearth or the shrine
            And the charge be unprovèd.

    VIII.

    "Bring the charge, prove the charge, brother! speak it aloud:
    Let thy father and hers hear it deep in his shroud!"
    --"O father, thou seest, for dead eyes can see,
    How she wears on her bosom a BROWN ROSARY,
            O my father belovèd!"

    IX.

    Then outlaughed the bridegroom, and outlaughed withal
    Both maidens and youths by the old chapel-wall:
    "So she weareth no love-gift, kind brother," quoth he,
    "She may wear an she listeth a brown rosary,
            Like a pure-hearted lady."

    X.

    Then swept through the chapel the long bridal train;
    Though he spake to the bride she replied not again:
    On, as one in a dream, pale and stately she went
    Where the altar-lights burn o'er the great sacrament,
            Faint with daylight, but steady.

    XI.

    But her brother had passed in between them and her,
    And calmly knelt down on the high-altar stair--
    Of an infantine aspect so stern to the view
    That the priest could not smile on the child's eyes of blue
            As he would for another.

    XII.

    He knelt like a child marble-sculptured and white
    That seems kneeling to pray on the tomb of a knight,
    With a look taken up to each iris of stone
    From the greatness and death where he kneeleth, but none
            From the face of a mother.

    XIII.

    "In your chapel, O priest, ye have wedded and shriven
    Fair wives for the hearth, and fair sinners for heaven;
    But this fairest my sister, ye think now to wed,
    Bid her kneel where she standeth, and shrive her instead:
            O shrive her and wed not!"

    XIV.

    In tears, the bride's mother,--"Sir priest, unto thee
    Would he lie, as he lied to this fair company."
    In wrath, the bride's lover,--"The lie shall be clear!
    Speak it out, boy! the saints in their niches shall hear:
            Be the charge proved or said not!"

    XV.

    Then serene in his childhood he lifted his face,
    And his voice sounded holy and fit for the place,--
    "Look down from your niches, ye still saints, and see
    How she wears on her bosom a BROWN ROSARY!
            Is it used for the praying?"

    XVI.

    The youths looked aside--to laugh there were a sin--
    And the maidens' lips trembled from smiles shut within.
    Quoth the priest, "Thou art wild, pretty boy! Blessed she
    Who prefers at her bridal a brown rosary
            To a worldly arraying."

    XVII.

    The bridegroom spake low and led onward the bride
    And before the high altar they stood side by side:
    The rite-book is opened, the rite is begun,
    They have knelt down together to rise up as one.
            Who laughed by the altar?

    XVIII.

    The maidens looked forward, the youths looked around,
    The bridegroom's eye flashed from his prayer at the sound;
    And each saw the bride, as if no bride she were,
    Gazing cold at the priest without gesture of prayer,
            As he read from the psalter.

    XIX.

    The priest never knew that she did so, but still
    He felt a power on him too strong for his will:
    And whenever the Great Name was there to be read,
    His voice sank to silence--THAT could not be said,
            Or the air could not hold it.

    XX.

    "I have sinnèd," quoth he, "I have sinnèd, I wot"--
    And the tears ran adown his old cheeks at the thought:
    They dropped fast on the book, but he read on the same,
    And aye was the silence where should be the NAME,--
            As the choristers told it.

    XXI.

    The rite-book is closed, and the rite being done
    They, who knelt down together, arise up as one:
    Fair riseth the bride--Oh, a fair bride is she,
    But, for all (think the maidens) that brown rosary,
            No saint at her praying!

    XXII.

    What aileth the bridegroom? He glares blank and wide;
    Then suddenly turning he kisseth the bride;
    His lips stung her with cold; she glanced upwardly mute:
    "Mine own wife," he said, and fell stark at her foot
            In the word he was saying.

    XXIII.

    They have lifted him up, but his head sinks away,
    And his face showeth bleak in the sunshine and grey.
    Leave him now where he lieth--for oh, never more
    Will he kneel at an altar or stand on a floor!
            Let his bride gaze upon him.

    XXIV.

    Long and still was her gaze while they chafèd him there
    And breathed in the mouth whose last life had kissed her,
    But when they stood up--only they! with a start
    The shriek from her soul struck her pale lips apart:
            She has lived, and forgone him!

    XXV.

    And low on his body she droppeth adown--
    "Didst call me thine own wife, belovèd--thine own?
    Then take thine own with thee! thy coldness is warm
    To the world's cold without thee! Come, keep me from harm
            In a calm of thy teaching!"

    XXVI.

    She looked in his face earnest-long, as in sooth
    There were hope of an answer, and then kissed his mouth,
    And with head on his bosom, wept, wept bitterly,--
    "Now, O God, take pity--take pity on me!
            God, hear my beseeching!"

    XXVII.

    She was 'ware of a shadow that crossed where she lay,
    She was 'ware of a presence that withered the day:
    Wild she sprang to her feet,--"I surrender to thee
    The broken vow's pledge, the accursed rosary,--
            I am ready for dying!"

    XXVIII.

    She dashed it in scorn to the marble-paved ground
    Where it fell mute as snow, and a weird music-sound
    Crept up, like a chill, up the aisles long and dim,--
    As the fiends tried to mock at the choristers' hymn
            And moaned in the trying.


FOURTH PART.


    Onora looketh listlessly adown the garden walk:
    "I am weary, O my mother, of thy tender talk.
    I am weary of the trees a-waving to and fro,
    Of the steadfast skies above, the running brooks below.
    All things are the same, but I,--only I am dreary,
    And, mother, of my dreariness behold me very weary.

    "Mother, brother, pull the flowers I planted in the spring
    And smiled to think I should smile more upon their gathering:
    The bees will find out other flowers--oh, pull them, dearest mine,
    And carry them and carry me before Saint Agnes' shrine."
    --Whereat they pulled the summer flowers she planted in the spring,
    And her and them all mournfully to Agnes' shrine did bring.

    She looked up to the pictured saint and gently shook her head--
    "The picture is too calm for me--too calm for me," she said:
    "The little flowers we brought with us, before it we may lay,
    For those are used to look at heaven,--but I must turn away,
    Because no sinner under sun can dare or bear to gaze
    On God's or angel's holiness, except in Jesu's face."

    She spoke with passion after pause--"And were it wisely done
    If we who cannot gaze above, should walk the earth alone?
    If we whose virtue is so weak should have a will so strong,
    And stand blind on the rocks to choose the right path from the wrong?
    To choose perhaps a love-lit hearth, instead of love and heaven,--
    A single rose, for a rose-tree which beareth seven times seven?
    A rose that droppeth from the hand, that fadeth in the breast,--
    Until, in grieving for the worst, we learn what is the best!"

    Then breaking into tears,--"Dear God," she cried, "and must we see
    All blissful things depart from us or ere we go to THEE?
    We cannot guess Thee in the wood or hear Thee in the wind?
    Our cedars must fall round us ere we see the light behind?
    Ay sooth, we feel too strong, in weal, to need thee on that road,
    But woe being come, the soul is dumb that crieth not on 'God.'"

    Her mother could not speak for tears; she ever musèd thus,
    "The bees will find out other flowers,--but what is left for us?"
    But her young brother stayed his sobs and knelt beside her knee,
    --"Thou sweetest sister in the world, hast never a word for me?"
    She passed her hand across his face, she pressed it on his cheek,
    So tenderly, so tenderly--she needed not to speak.

    The wreath which lay on shrine that day, at vespers bloomed no more.
    The woman fair who placed it there had died an hour before.
    Both perished mute for lack of root, earth's nourishment to reach.
    O reader, breathe (the ballad saith) some sweetness out of each!




A ROMANCE OF THE GANGES.


    I.

    Seven maidens 'neath the midnight
      Stand near the river-sea
    Whose water sweepeth white around
      The shadow of the tree;
    The moon and earth are face to face,
      And earth is slumbering deep;
    The wave-voice seems the voice of dreams
      That wander through her sleep:
                        The river floweth on.

    II.

    What bring they 'neath the midnight,
      Beside the river-sea?
    They bring the human heart wherein
      No nightly calm can be,--
    That droppeth never with the wind,
      Nor drieth with the dew:
    Oh, calm in God! thy calm is broad
      To cover spirits too.
                        The river floweth on.

    III.

    The maidens lean them over
      The waters, side by side,
    And shun each other's deepening eyes,
      And gaze adown the tide;
    For each within a little boat
      A little lamp hath put,
    And heaped for freight some lily's weight
      Or scarlet rose half shut.
                        The river floweth on.

    IV.

    Of shell of cocoa carven
      Each little boat is made;
    Each carries a lamp, and carries a flower,
      And carries a hope unsaid;
    And when the boat hath carried the lamp
      Unquenched till out of sight,
    The maiden is sure that love will endure;
      But love will fail with light.
                        The river floweth on.

    V.

    Why, all the stars are ready
      To symbolize the soul,
    The stars untroubled by the wind,
      Unwearied as they roll;
    And yet the soul by instinct sad
      Reverts to symbols low--
    To that small flame, whose very name
      Breathed o'er it, shakes it so!
                        The river floweth on.

    VI.

    Six boats are on the river,
      Seven maidens on the shore,
    While still above them steadfastly
      The stars shine evermore.
    Go, little boats, go soft and safe,
      And guard the symbol spark!
    The boats aright go safe and bright
      Across the waters dark.
                        The river floweth on.

    VII.

    The maiden Luti watcheth
      Where onwardly they float:
    That look in her dilating eyes
      Might seem to drive her boat:
    Her eyes still mark the constant fire,
      And kindling unawares
    That hopeful while, she lets a smile
      Creep silent through her prayers.
                        The river floweth on.

    VIII.

    The smile--where hath it wandered?
      She riseth from her knee,
    She holds her dark, wet locks away--
      There is no light to see!
    She cries a quick and bitter cry--
      "Nuleeni, launch me thine!
    We must have light abroad to-night,
      For all the wreck of mine."
                        The river floweth on.

    IX.

    "I do remember watching
      Beside this river-bed
    When on my childish knee was leaned
      My dying father's head;
    I turned mine own to keep the tears
      From falling on his face:
    What doth it prove when Death and Love
      Choose out the self-same place?"
                        The river floweth on.

    X.

    "They say the dead are joyful
      The death-change here receiving:
    Who say--ah me! who dare to say
      Where joy comes to the living?
    Thy boat, Nuleeni! look not sad--
      Light up the waters rather!
    I weep no faithless lover where
      I wept a loving father."
                        The river floweth on.

    XI.

    "My heart foretold his falsehood
      Ere my little boat grew dim;
    And though I closed mine eyes to dream
      That one last dream of him,
    They shall not now be wet to see
      The shining vision go:
    From earth's cold love I look above
      To the holy house of snow."[2]
                        The river floweth on.

    XII.

    "Come thou--thou never knewest
      A grief, that thou shouldst fear one!
    Thou wearest still the happy look
      That shines beneath a dear one:
    Thy humming-bird is in the sun,[3]
      Thy cuckoo in the grove,
    And all the three broad worlds, for thee
      Are full of wandering love."
                        The river floweth on.

    XIII.

    "Why, maiden, dost thou loiter?
      What secret wouldst thou cover?
    That peepul cannot hide thy boat,
      And I can guess thy lover;
    I heard thee sob his name in sleep,
      It was a name I knew:
    Come, little maid, be not afraid,
      But let us prove him true!"
                        The river floweth on.

    XIV.

    The little maiden cometh,
      She cometh shy and slow;
    I ween she seeth through her lids
      They drop adown so low:
    Her tresses meet her small bare feet,
      She stands and speaketh nought,
    Yet blusheth red as if she said
      The name she only thought.
                        The river floweth on.

    XV.

    She knelt beside the water,
      She lighted up the flame,
    And o'er her youthful forehead's calm
      The fitful radiance came:--
    "Go, little boat, go soft and safe,
      And guard the symbol spark!"
    Soft, safe doth float the little boat
      Across the waters dark.
                        The river floweth on.

    XVI.

    Glad tears her eyes have blinded,
      The light they cannot reach;
    She turneth with that sudden smile
      She learnt before her speech--
    "I do not hear his voice, the tears
      Have dimmed my light away,
    But the symbol light will last to-night,
      The love will last for aye!"
                        The river floweth on.

    XVII.

    Then Luti spake behind her,
      Outspake she bitterly--
    "By the symbol light that lasts to-night,
      Wilt vow a vow to me?"
    Nuleeni gazeth up her face,
      Soft answer maketh she--
    "By loves that last when lights are past,
      I vow that vow to thee!"
                        The river floweth on.

    XVIII.

    An earthly look had Luti
      Though her voice was deep as prayer--
    "The rice is gathered from the plains
      To cast upon thine hair:[4]
    But when he comes his marriage-band
      Around thy neck to throw,
    Thy bride-smile raise to meet his gaze,
    And whisper,--There is one betrays,
      While Luti suffers woe."
                        The river floweth on.

    XIX.

    "And when in seasons after,
      Thy little bright-faced son
    Shall lean against thy knee and ask
      What deeds his sire hath done,--
    Press deeper down thy mother-smile
      His glossy curls among,
    View deep his pretty childish eyes,
    And whisper,--There is none denies,
      While Luti speaks of wrong."
                        The river floweth on.

    XX.

    Nuleeni looked in wonder,
      Yet softly answered she--
    "By loves that last when lights are past,
      I vowed that vow to thee:
    But why glads it thee that a bride-day be
      By a word of woe defiled?
    That a word of wrong take the cradle-song
      From the ear of a sinless child?"
    "Why?" Luti said, and her laugh was dread,
      And her eyes dilated wild--
    "That the fair new love may her bridegroom prove,
      And the father shame the child!"
                        The river floweth on.

    XXI.

    "Thou flowest still, O river,
      Thou flowest 'neath the moon;
    Thy lily hath not changed a leaf,[5]
      Thy charmèd lute a tune:
    He mixed his voice with thine and his
      Was all I heard around;
    But now, beside his chosen bride,
      I hear the river's sound."
                        The river floweth on.

    XXII.

    "I gaze upon her beauty
      Through the tresses that enwreathe it;
    The light above thy wave, is hers--
      My rest, alone beneath it:
    Oh, give me back the dying look
      My father gave thy water!
    Give back--and let a little love
      O'erwatch his weary daughter!"
                        The river floweth on.

    XXIII.

    "Give back!" she hath departed--
      The word is wandering with her;
    And the stricken maidens hear afar
      The step and cry together.
    Frail symbols? None are frail enow
      For mortal joys to borrow!--
    While bright doth float Nuleeni's boat,
      She weepeth dark with sorrow.
                        The river floweth on.


RHYME OF THE DUCHESS MAY.


    I.

    To the belfry, one by one, went the ringers from the sun,
                          Toll slowly.
    And the oldest ringer said, "Ours is music for the dead
              When the rebecks are all done."

    II.

    Six abeles i' the churchyard grow on the north side in a row,
                          Toll slowly.
    And the shadows of their tops rock across the little slopes
              Of the grassy graves below.

    III.

    On the south side and the west a small river runs in haste,
                          Toll slowly.
    And, between the river flowing and the fair green trees a-growing,
              Do the dead lie at their rest.

    IV.

    On the east I sate that day, up against a willow grey:
                          Toll slowly.
    Through the rain of willow-branches I could see the low hill-ranges
              And the river on its way.

    V.

    There I sate beneath the tree, and the bell tolled solemnly,
                          Toll slowly.
    While the trees' and river's voices flowed between the solemn noises,--
              Yet death seemed more loud to me.

    VI.

    There I read this ancient rhyme while the bell did all the time
                          Toll slowly.
    And the solemn knell fell in with the tale of life and sin,
              Like a rhythmic fate sublime.


THE RHYME.


    I.

    Broad the forests stood (I read) on the hills of Linteged,
                          Toll slowly.
    And three hundred years had stood mute adown each hoary wood,
              Like a full heart having prayed.

    II.

    And the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west,
                          Toll slowly.
    And but little thought was theirs of the silent antique years,
              In the building of their nest.

    III.

    Down the sun dropt large and red on the towers of Linteged,--
                          Toll slowly.
    Lance and spear upon the height, bristling strange in fiery light,
              While the castle stood in shade.

    IV.

    There the castle stood up black with the red sun at its back--
                          Toll slowly--
    Like a sullen smouldering pyre with a top that flickers fire
              When the wind is on its track.

    V.

    And five hundred archers tall did besiege the castle wall--
                          Toll slowly.
    And the castle, seethed in blood, fourteen days and nights had stood
              And to-night was near its fall.

    VI.

    Yet thereunto, blind to doom, three months since, a bride did come--
                          Toll slowly.
    One who proudly trod the floors and softly whispered in the doors,
              "May good angels bless our home."

    VII.

    Oh, a bride of queenly eyes, with a front of constancies:
                          Toll slowly.
    Oh, a bride of cordial mouth where the untired smile of youth
              Did light outward its own sighs!

    VIII.

    'T was a Duke's fair orphan-girl, and her uncle's ward--the Earl--
                          Toll slowly.
    Who betrothed her twelve years old, for the sake of dowry gold,
              To his son Lord Leigh the churl.

    IX.

    But what time she had made good all her years of womanhood--
                          Toll slowly.
    Unto both these lords of Leigh spake she out right sovranly,
              "My will runneth as my blood.

    X.

    "And while this same blood makes red this same right hand's veins,"
        she said--
                        Toll slowly--
    "'T is my will, as lady free, not to wed a lord of Leigh,
                    But Sir Guy of Linteged."

    XI.

    The old Earl he smilèd smooth, then he sighed for wilful youth--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Good my niece, that hand withal looketh somewhat soft and small
                    For so large a will, in sooth."

    XII.

    She too smiled by that same sign, but her smile was cold and fine--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Little hand clasps muckle gold, or it were not worth the hold
                    Of thy son, good uncle mine!"

    XIII.

    Then the young lord jerked his breath, and sware thickly in his teeth--
                        Toll slowly--
    "He would wed his own betrothed, an she loved him an she loathed,
                    Let the life come or the death."

    XIV.

    Up she rose with scornful eyes, as her father's child might rise--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Thy hound's blood, my lord of Leigh, stains thy knightly heel,"
        quoth she,
                    "And he moans not where he lies:

    XV.

    "But a woman's will dies hard, in the hall or on the sward"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "By that grave, my lords, which made me orphaned girl and dowered lady,
                    I deny you wife and ward!"

    XVI.

    Unto each she bowed her head and swept past with lofty tread.
                        Toll slowly.
    Ere the midnight-bell had ceased, in the chapel had the priest
                    Blessed her, bride of Linteged.

    XVII.

    Fast and fain the bridal train along the night-storm rode amain--
                        Toll slowly.
    Hard the steeds of lord and serf struck their hoofs out on the turf,
                        In the pauses of the rain.

    XVIII.

    Fast and fain the kinsmen's train along the storm pursued amain--
                        Toll slowly.
    Steed on steed-track, dashing off,--thickening, doubling, hoof on hoof,
                    In the pauses of the rain.

    XIX.

    And the bridegroom led the flight on his red-roan steed of might--
                        Toll slowly.
    And the bride lay on his arm, still, as if she feared no harm,
                    Smiling out into the night.

    XX.

    "Dost thou fear?" he said at last. "Nay," she answered him in haste,--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Not such death as we could find--only life with one behind.
                    Ride on fast as fear, ride fast!"

    XXI.

    Up the mountain wheeled the steed--girth to ground, and fetlocks
        spread--
                        Toll slowly.
    Headlong bounds, and rocking flanks,--down he staggered, down the
        banks,
                    To the towers of Linteged.

    XXII.

    High and low the serfs looked out, red the flambeaus tossed about--
                        Toll slowly.
    In the courtyard rose the cry, "Live the Duchess and Sir Guy!"
                        But she never heard them shout.

    XXIII.

    On the steed she dropped her cheek, kissed his mane and kissed his
        neck--
                        Toll slowly.
    "I had happier died by thee than lived on, a Lady Leigh,"
                    Were the first words she did speak.

    XXIV.

    But a three months' joyaunce lay 'twixt that moment and to-day--
                        Toll slowly.
    When five hundred archers tall stand beside the castle wall
                    To recapture Duchess May.

    XXV.

    And the castle standeth black with the red sun at its back--
                        Toll slowly.
    And a fortnight's siege is done, and, except the duchess, none
                    Can misdoubt the coming wrack.

    XXVI.

    Then the captain, young Lord Leigh, with his eyes so grey of blee--
                        Toll slowly.
    And thin lips that scarcely sheath the cold white gnashing of his
        teeth,
                    Gnashed in smiling, absently,--

    XXVII.

    Cried aloud, "So goes the day, bridegroom fair of Duchess May!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Look thy last upon that sun! if thou seest to-morrow's one
                    'T will be through a foot of clay.

    XXVIII.

    "Ha, fair bride! dost hear no sound save that moaning of the hound?"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Thou and I have parted troth, yet I keep my vengeance-oath,
                    And the other may come round.

    XXIX.

    "Ha! thy will is brave to dare, and thy new love past compare"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Yet thine old love's falchion brave is as strong a thing to have,
                    As the will of lady fair.

    XXX.

    "Peck on blindly, netted dove! If a wife's name thee behove"--
                        Toll slowly--
    "Thou shalt wear the same to-morrow, ere the grave has hid the sorrow
                    Of thy last ill-mated love.

    XXXI.

    "O'er his fixed and silent mouth, thou and I will call back troth":
                        Toll slowly.
    "He shall altar be and priest,--and he will not cry at least
                    'I forbid you, I am loth!'

    XXXII.

    "I will wring thy fingers pale in the gauntlet of my mail":
                        Toll slowly.
    "'Little hand and muckle gold' close shall lie within my hold,
                    As the sword did, to prevail."

    XXXIII.

    Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west--
                        Toll slowly.
    Oh, and laughed the Duchess May, and her soul did put away
                    All his boasting, for a jest.

    XXXIV.

    In her chamber did she sit, laughing low to think of it,--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Tower is strong and will is free: thou canst boast, my lord of Leigh,
                    But thou boastest little wit."

    XXXV.

    In her tire-glass gazèd she, and she blushed right womanly--
                        Toll slowly.
    She blushed half from her disdain, half her beauty was so plain,
                    --"Oath for oath, my lord of Leigh!"

    XXXVI.

    Straight she called her maidens in--"Since ye gave me blame herein"--
                        Toll slowly--
    "That a bridal such as mine should lack gauds to make it fine,
                    Come and shrive me from that sin.

    XXXVII.

    "It is three months gone to-day since I gave mine hand away":
                        Toll slowly.
    "Bring the gold and bring the gem, we will keep bride-state in them,
                    While we keep the foe at bay.

    XXXVIII.

    "On your arms I loose mine hair; comb it smooth and crown it fair":
                        Toll slowly.
    "I would look in purple pall from this lattice down the wall,
                    And throw scorn to one that's there!"

    XXXIX.

    Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west--
                        Toll slowly.
    On the tower the castle's lord leant in silence on his sword,
                    With an anguish in his breast.

    XL.

    With a spirit-laden weight did he lean down passionate:
                        Toll slowly.
    They have almost sapped the wall,--they will enter therewithal
                    With no knocking at the gate.

    XLI.

    Then the sword he leant upon, shivered, snapped upon the stone--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Sword," he thought, with inward laugh, "ill thou servest for a staff
                    When thy nobler use is done!

    XLII.

    "Sword, thy nobler use is done! tower is lost, and shame begun!"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "If we met them in the breach, hilt to hilt or speech to speech,
                    We should die there, each for one.

    XLIII.

    "If we met them at the wall, we should singly, vainly fall"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "But if I die here alone,--then I die who am but one,
                    And die nobly for them all.

    XLIV.

    "Five true friends lie for my sake in the moat and in the brake"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Thirteen warriors lie at rest with a black wound in the breast,
                    And not one of these will wake.

    XLV.

    "So, no more of this shall be! heart-blood weighs too heavily"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "And I could not sleep in grave, with the faithful and the brave
                    Heaped around and over me.

    XLVI.

    "Since young Clare a mother hath, and young Ralph a plighted faith"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Since my pale young sister's cheeks blush like rose when Ronald
        speaks,
                    Albeit never a word she saith--

    XLVII.

    "These shall never die for me: life-blood falls too heavily":
                        Toll slowly.
    "And if I die here apart, o'er my dead and silent heart
                    They shall pass out safe and free.

    XLVIII.

    "When the foe hath heard it said--'Death holds Guy of Linteged'"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "That new corse new peace shall bring, and a blessèd, blessèd thing
                    Shall the stone be at its head.

    XLIX.

    "Then my friends shall pass out free, and shall bear my memory"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Then my foes shall sleek their pride, soothing fair my widowed bride
                    Whose sole sin was love of me:

    L.

    "With their words all smooth and sweet, they will front her and
        entreat"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "And their purple pall will spread underneath her fainting head
                    While her tears drop over it.

    LI.

    "She will weep her woman's tears, she will pray her woman's prayers"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "But her heart is young in pain, and her hopes will spring again
                    By the suntime of her years.

    LII.

    "Ah, sweet May! ah, sweetest grief!--once I vowed thee my belief"--
                        Toll slowly--
    "That thy name expressed thy sweetness,--May of poets, in completeness!
                    Now my May-day seemeth brief."

    LIII.

    All these silent thoughts did swim o'er his eyes grown strange and
        dim--
                        Toll slowly.
    Till his true men, in the place, wished they stood there face to face
                    With the foe instead of him.

    LIV.

    "One last oath, my friends that wear faithful hearts to do and dare!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Tower must fall and bride be lost--swear me service worth the cost!"
                    Bold they stood around to swear.

    LV.

    "Each man clasp my hand and swear by the deed we failed in there"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Not for vengeance, not for right, will ye strike one blow to-night!"
                    Pale they stood around to swear.

    LVI.

    "One last boon, young Ralph and Clare! faithful hearts to do and dare!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Bring that steed up from his stall, which she kissed before you all.
                    Guide him up the turret-stair.

    LVII.

    "Ye shall harness him aright, and lead upward to this height:"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Once in love and twice in war hath he borne me strong and far:
                    He shall bear me far to-night."

    LVIII.

    Then his men looked to and fro, when they heard him speaking so--
                        Toll slowly.
    "'Las! the noble heart," they thought, "he in sooth is grief-
        distraught:
                    Would we stood here with the foe!"

    LIX.

    But a fire flashed from his eye, 'twixt their thought and their reply--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Have ye so much time to waste? We who ride here, must ride fast
                    As we wish our foes to fly."

    LX.

    They have fetched the steed with care, in the harness he did wear--
                        Toll slowly.
    Past the court and through the doors, across the rushes of the floors,
                    But they goad him up the stair.

    LXI.

    Then from out her bower chambère did the Duchess May repair:
                        Toll slowly.
    "Tell me now what is your need," said the lady, "of this steed,
                    That ye goad him up the stair?"

    LXII.

    Calm she stood; unbodkined through, fell her dark hair to her shoe:
                        Toll slowly.
    And the smile upon her face, ere she left the tiring-glass,
                    Had not time enough to go.

    LXIII.

    "Get thee back, sweet Duchess May! hope is gone like yesterday":
                        Toll slowly.
    One half-hour completes the breach; and thy lord grows wild of speech--
                    Get thee in, sweet lady, and pray!

    LXIV.

    "In the east tower, high'st of all, loud he cries for steed from
        stall":
                        Toll slowly.
    "'He would ride as far,' quoth he, 'as for love and victory,
                    Though he rides the castle-wall.'

    LXV.

    "And we fetch the steed from stall, up where never a hoof did fall"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Wifely prayer meets deathly need: may the sweet Heavens hear thee
        plead
                    If he rides the castle-wall!"

    LXVI.

    Low she dropt her head, and lower, till her hair coiled on the floor--
                        Toll slowly.
    And tear after tear you heard fall distinct as any word
                    Which you might be listening for.

    LXVII.

    "Get thee in, thou soft ladye! here is never a place for thee!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Braid thine hair and clasp thy gown, that thy beauty in its moan
                    May find grace with Leigh of Leigh."

    LXVIII.

    She stood up in bitter case, with a pale yet steady face:
                        Toll slowly.
    Like a statue thunderstruck, which, though quivering, seems to look
                    Right against the thunder-place.

    LXIX.

    And her foot trod in, with pride, her own tears i' the stone beside--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Go to, faithful friends, go to! judge no more what ladies do,
                    No, nor how their lords may ride!"

    LXX.

    Then the good steed's rein she took, and his neck did kiss and stroke:
                        Toll slowly.
    Soft he neighed to answer her, and then followed up the stair
                    For the love of her sweet look:

    LXXI.

    Oh, and steeply, steeply wound up the narrow stair around--
                        Toll slowly.
    Oh, and closely, closely speeding, step by step beside her treading
                    Did he follow, meek as hound.

    LXXII.

    On the east tower, high'st of all,--there, where never a hoof did
        fall--
                        Toll slowly.
    Out they swept, a vision steady, noble steed and lovely lady,
                    Calm as if in bower or stall.

    LXXIII.

    Down she knelt at her lord's knee, and she looked up silently--
                        Toll slowly.
    And he kissed her twice and thrice, for that look within her eyes
                    Which he could not bear to see.

    LXXIV.

    Quoth he, "Get thee from this strife, and the sweet saints bless thy
        life!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "In this hour I stand in need of my noble red-roan steed,
                    But no more of my noble wife."

    LXXV.

    Quoth she, "Meekly have I done all thy biddings under sun":
                        Toll slowly.
    "But by all my womanhood, which is proved so, true and good,
                    I will never do this one.

    LXXVI.

    "Now by womanhood's degree and by wifehood's verity"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "In this hour if thou hast need of thy noble red-roan steed,
                    Thou hast also need of me.

    LXXVII.

    "By this golden ring ye see on this lifted hand pardiè"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "If, this hour, on castle-wall can be room for steed from stall,
                    Shall be also room for me.

    LXXVIII.

    "So the sweet saints with me be," (did she utter solemnly)--
                        Toll slowly.
    "If a man, this eventide, on this castle wall will ride,
                    He shall ride the same with me."

    LXXIX.

    Oh, he sprang up in the selle and he laughed out bitter-well--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Wouldst thou ride among the leaves, as we used on other eves,
                    To hear chime a vesper-bell?"

    LXXX.

    She clung closer to his knee--"Ay, beneath the cypress-tree!"
                        Toll slowly.
    "Mock me not, for otherwhere than along the greenwood fair
                    Have I ridden fast with thee.

    LXXXI.

    "Fast I rode with new-made vows from my angry kinsman's house":
                        Toll slowly.
    "What, and would you men should reck that I dared more for love's sake
                    As a bride than as a spouse?

    LXXXII.

    "What, and would you it should fall, as a proverb, before all"--
                        Toll slowly.
    "That a bride may keep your side while through castle-gate you ride,
                    Yet eschew the castle-wall?"

    LXXXIII.

    Ho! the breach yawns into ruin and roars up against her suing--
                        Toll slowly.
    With the inarticulate din and the dreadful falling in--
                    Shrieks of doing and undoing!

    LXXXIV.

    Twice he wrung her hands in twain, but the small hands closed again.
                        Toll slowly.
    Back he reined the steed--back, back! but she trailed along his track
                    With a frantic clasp and strain.

    LXXXV.

    Evermore the foemen pour through the crash of window and door--
                        Toll slowly.
    And the shouts of Leigh and Leigh, and the shrieks of "kill!" and
        "flee!"
                    Strike up clear amid the roar.

    LXXXVI.

    Thrice he wrung her hands in twain, but they closed and clung again--
                        Toll slowly.
    While she clung, as one, withstood, clasps a Christ upon the rood,
                    In a spasm of deathly pain.

    LXXXVII.

    She clung wild and she clung mute with her shuddering lips half-shut.
                        Toll slowly.
    Her head fallen as half in swound, hair and knee swept on the ground,
                    She clung wild to stirrup and foot.

    LXXXVIII.

    Back he reined his steed back-thrown on the slippery coping-stone:
                        Toll slowly.
    Back the iron hoofs did grind on the battlement behind
                    Whence a hundred feet went down:

    LXXXIX.

    And his heel did press and goad on the quivering flank bestrode--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Friends and brothers, save my wife! Pardon, sweet, in change for
        life,--
                    But I ride alone to God."

    XC.

    Straight as if the Holy name had upbreathed her like a flame--
                        Toll slowly.
    She upsprang, she rose upright, in his selle she sate in sight,
                    By her love she overcame.

    XCI.

    And her head was on his breast where she smiled as one at rest--
                        Toll slowly.
    "Ring," she cried, "O vesper-bell in the beechwood's old chapelle--
                    But the passing-bell rings best!"

    XCII.

    They have caught out at the rein which Sir Guy threw loose--in vain--
                        Toll slowly.
    For the horse in stark despair, with his front hoofs poised in air,
                    On the last verge rears amain.

    XCIII.

    Now he hangs, he rocks between, and his nostrils curdle in--
                        Toll slowly.
    Now he shivers head and hoof and the flakes of foam fall off,
                    And his face grows fierce and thin:

    XCIV.

    And a look of human woe from his staring eyes did go:
                        Toll slowly.
    And a sharp cry uttered he, in a foretold agony
                    Of the headlong death below,--

    XCV.

    And, "Ring, ring, thou passing-bell," still she cried, "i' the old
        chapelle!"
                        Toll slowly.
    Then, back-toppling, crashing back--a dead weight flung out to wrack,
                    Horse and riders overfell.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west--
                        Toll slowly.
    And I read this ancient Rhyme, in the churchyard, while the chime
                    Slowly tolled for one at rest.

    II.

    The abeles moved in the sun, and the river smooth did run--
                        Toll slowly.
    And the ancient Rhyme rang strange, with its passion and its change,
                    Here, where all done lay undone.

    III.

    And beneath a willow tree I a little grave did see--
                        Toll slowly--
    Where was graved--HERE, UNDEFILED, LIETH MAUD, A THREE-YEAR CHILD,
                    EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FORTY-THREE.

    IV.

    Then O spirits, did I say, ye who rode so fast that day--
                        Toll slowly.
    Did star-wheels and angel wings with their holy winnowings
                    Keep beside you all the way?

    V.

    Though in passion ye would dash, with a blind and heavy crash--
                        Toll slowly--
    Up against the thick-bossed shield of God's judgment in the field,--
                    Though your heart and brain were rash,--

    VI.

    Now, your will is all unwilled; now, your pulses are all stilled:
                        Toll slowly.
    Now, ye lie as meek and mild (whereso laid) as Maud the child
                    Whose small grave was lately filled.

    VII.

    Beating heart and burning brow, ye are very patient now--
                        Toll slowly.
    And the children might be bold to pluck the kingcups from your mould
                    Ere a month had let them grow.

    VIII.

    And you let the goldfinch sing in the alder near in spring--
                        Toll slowly.
    Let her build her nest and sit all the three weeks out on it,
                    Murmuring not at anything.

    IX.

    In your patience ye are strong, cold and heat ye take not wrong--
                        Toll slowly.
    When the trumpet of the angel blows eternity's evangel,
                    Time will seem to you not long.

    X.

    Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west--
                        Toll slowly.
    And I said in underbreath,--All our life is mixed with death,
                    And who knoweth which is best?

    XI.

    Oh, the little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west--
                        Toll slowly.
    And I smiled to think God's greatness flowed around our
        incompleteness,--
                    Round our restlessness, His rest.




THE ROMANCE OF THE SWAN'S NEST.

    So the dreams depart,
    So the fading phantoms flee,
    And the sharp reality
    Now must act its part.

    WESTWOOD'S Beads from a Rosary


    I.

    Little Ellie sits alone
      'Mid the beeches of a meadow,
        By a stream-side on the grass,
    And the trees are showering down
      Doubles of their leaves in shadow
        On her shining hair and face.

    II.

    She has thrown her bonnet by,
      And her feet she has been dipping
        In the shallow water's flow:
    Now she holds them nakedly
      In her hands, all sleek and dripping,
        While she rocketh to and fro.

    III.

    Little Ellie sits alone,
      And the smile she softly uses
        Fills the silence like a speech
    While she thinks what shall be done,
      And the sweetest pleasure chooses
        For her future within reach.

    IV.

    Little Ellie in her smile
      Chooses--"I will have a lover
        Riding on a steed of steeds:
    He shall love me without guile,
      And to him I will discover
        The swan's nest among the reeds.

    V.

    "And the steed shall be red-roan,
      And the lover shall be noble,
        With an eye that takes the breath:
    And the lute he plays upon
      Shall strike ladies into trouble,
        As his sword strikes men to death.

    VI.

    "And the steed it shall be shod
      All in silver, housed in azure,
        And the mane shall swim the wind;
    And the hoofs along the sod
      Shall flash onward and keep measure,
        Till the shepherds look behind.

    VII.

    "But my lover will not prize
      All the glory that he rides in,
        When he gazes in my face:
    He will say, 'O Love, thine eyes
      Build the shrine my soul abides in,
        And I kneel here for thy grace!'

    VIII.

    "Then, ay, then he shall kneel low,
      With the red-roan steed anear him
        Which shall seem to understand,
    Till I answer, 'Rise and go!
      For the world must love and fear him
        Whom I gift with heart and hand.'

    IX.

    "Then he will arise so pale,
      I shall feel my own lips tremble
        With a yes I must not say,
    Nathless maiden-brave, 'Farewell,'
      I will utter, and dissemble--
        'Light to-morrow with to-day!'

    X.

    "Then he'll ride among the hills
      To the wide world past the river,
        There to put away all wrong;
    To make straight distorted wills,
      And to empty the broad quiver
        Which the wicked bear along.

    XI.

    "Three times shall a young foot-page
      Swim the stream and climb the mountain
        And kneel down beside my feet--
    'Lo, my master sends this gage,
      Lady, for thy pity's counting!
        What wilt thou exchange for it?'

    XII.

    "And the first time I will send
      A white rosebud for a guerdon,
        And the second time, a glove;
    But the third time--I may bend
      From my pride, and answer--'Pardon
        If he comes to take my love.'

    XIII.

    "Then the young foot-page will run,
      Then my lover will ride faster,
        Till he kneeleth at my knee:
    'I am a duke's eldest son,
      Thousand serfs do call me master,
        But, O Love, I love but thee!'

    XIV.

    "He will kiss me on the mouth
      Then, and lead me as a lover
        Through the crowds that praise his deeds;
    And, when soul-tied by one troth,
      Unto him I will discover
        That swan's nest among the reeds."

    XV.

    Little Ellie, with her smile
      Not yet ended, rose up gaily,
        Tied the bonnet, donned the shoe,
    And went homeward, round a mile,
      Just to see, as she did daily,
        What more eggs were with the two.

    XVI.

    Pushing through the elm-tree copse,
      Winding up the stream, light-hearted,
        Where the osier pathway leads,
    Past the boughs she stoops--and stops.
      Lo, the wild swan had deserted,
        And a rat had gnawed the reeds!

    XVII.

    Ellie went home sad and slow.
      If she found the lover ever,
        With his red-roan steed of steeds,
    Sooth I know not; but I know
      She could never show him--never,
        That swan's nest among the reeds!




BERTHA IN THE LANE.


    I.

    Put the broidery-frame away,
      For my sewing is all done:
    The last thread is used to-day,
      And I need not join it on.
    Though the clock stands at the noon
    I am weary. I have sewn,
    Sweet, for thee, a wedding-gown.

    II.

    Sister, help me to the bed,
      And stand near me, Dearest-sweet.
    Do not shrink nor be afraid,
      Blushing with a sudden heat!
    No one standeth in the street?--
    By God's love I go to meet,
    Love I thee with love complete.

    III.

    Lean thy face down; drop it in
      These two hands, that I may hold
    'Twixt their palms thy cheek and chin,
      Stroking back the curls of gold:
    'T is a fair, fair face, in sooth--
    Larger eyes and redder mouth
    Than mine were in my first youth.

    IV.

    Thou art younger by seven years--
      Ah!--so bashful at my gaze,
    That the lashes, hung with tears,
      Grow too heavy to upraise?
    I would wound thee by no touch
    Which thy shyness feels as such.
    Dost thou mind me, Dear, so much?

    V.

    Have I not been nigh a mother
      To thy sweetness--tell me, Dear?
    Have we not loved one another
      Tenderly, from year to year,
    Since our dying mother mild
    Said with accents undefiled,
    "Child, be mother to this child"!

    VI.

    Mother, mother, up in heaven,
      Stand up on the jasper sea,
    And be witness I have given
      All the gifts required of me,--
    Hope that blessed me, bliss that crowned,
    Love that left me with a wound,
    Life itself that turneth round!

    VII.

      Thou art standing in the room,
    In a molten glory shrined
      That rays off into the gloom!
    But thy smile is bright and bleak
    Like cold waves--I cannot speak,
    I sob in it, and grow weak.

    VIII.

    Ghostly mother, keep aloof
      One hour longer from my soul,
    For I still am thinking of
      Earth's warm-beating joy and dole!
    On my finger is a ring
    Which I still see glittering
    When the night hides everything.

    IX.

    Little sister, thou art pale!
      Ah, I have a wandering brain--
    But I lose that fever-bale,
      And my thoughts grow calm again.
    Lean down closer--closer still!
    I have words thine ear to fill,
    And would kiss thee at my will.

    X.

    Dear, I heard thee in the spring,
      Thee and Robert--through the trees,--
    When we all went gathering
      Boughs of May-bloom for the bees.
    Do not start so! think instead
    How the sunshine overhead
    Seemed to trickle through the shade.

    XI.

    What a day it was, that day!
      Hills and vales did openly
    Seem to heave and throb away
      At the sight of the great sky:
    And the silence, as it stood
    In the glory's golden flood,
    Audibly did bud, and bud.

    XII.

    Through the winding hedgerows green,
      How we wandered, I and you,
    With the bowery tops shut in,
      And the gates that showed the view!
    How we talked there; thrushes soft
    Sang our praises out, or oft
    Bleatings took them from the croft:

    XIII.

    Till the pleasure grown too strong
      Left me muter evermore,
    And, the winding road being long,
      I walked out of sight, before,
    And so, wrapt in musings fond,
    Issued (past the wayside pond)
    On the meadow-lands beyond.

    XIV.

    I sate down beneath the beech
      Which leans over to the lane,
    And the far sound of your speech
      Did not promise any pain;
    And I blessed you full and free,
    With a smile stooped tenderly
    O'er the May-flowers on my knee.

    XV.

    But the sound grew into word
      As the speakers drew more near--
    Sweet, forgive me that I heard
      What you wished me not to hear.
    Do not weep so, do not shake,
    Oh,--I heard thee, Bertha, make
    Good true answers for my sake.

    XVI.

    Yes, and HE too! let him stand
      In thy thoughts, untouched by blame.
    Could he help it, if my hand
      He had claimed with hasty claim?
    That was wrong perhaps--but then
    Such things be--and will, again.
    Women cannot judge for men.

    XVII.

    Had he seen thee when he swore
      He would love but me alone?
    Thou wast absent, sent before
      To our kin in Sidmouth town.
    When he saw thee who art best
    Past compare, and loveliest.
    He but judged thee as the rest.

    XVIII.

    Could we blame him with grave words,
      Thou and I, Dear, if we might?
    Thy brown eyes have looks like birds
      Flying straightway to the light:
    Mine are older.--Hush!--look out--
    Up the street! Is none without?
    How the poplar swings about!

    XIX.

    And that hour--beneath the beech,
      When I listened in a dream,
    And he said in his deep speech
      That he owed me all esteem,--
    Each word swam in on my brain
    With a dim, dilating pain,
    Till it burst with that last strain.

    XX.

    I fell flooded with a dark,
      In the silence of a swoon.
    When I rose, still cold and stark,
      There was night; I saw the moon
    And the stars, each in its place,
    And the May-blooms on the grass,
    Seemed to wonder what I was.

    XXI.

    And I walked as if apart
      From myself, when I could stand,
    And I pitied my own heart,
      As if I held it in my hand--
    Somewhat coldly, with a sense
    Of fulfilled benevolence,
    And a "Poor thing" negligence.

    XXII.

    And I answered coldly too,
      When you met me at the door;
    And I only heard the dew
      Dripping from me to the floor:
    And the flowers, I bade you see,
    Were too withered for the bee,--
    As my life, henceforth, for me.

    XXIII.

    Do not weep so--Dear,--heart-warm!
      All was best as it befell.
    If I say he did me harm,
      I speak wild,--I am not well.
    All his words were kind and good--
    He esteemed me. Only, blood
    Runs so faint in womanhood!

    XXIV.

    Then I always was too grave,--
      Liked the saddest ballad sung,--
    With that look, besides, we have
      In our faces, who die young.
    I had died, Dear, all the same;
    Life's long, joyous, jostling game
    Is too loud for my meek shame.

    XXV.

    We are so unlike each other,
      Thou and I, that none could guess
    We were children of one mother,
      But for mutual tenderness.
    Thou art rose-lined from the cold,
    And meant verily to hold
    Life's pure pleasures manifold.

    XXVI.

    I am pale as crocus grows
      Close beside a rose-tree's root;
    Whosoe'er would reach the rose,
      Treads the crocus underfoot.
    I, like May-bloom on thorn-tree,
    Thou, like merry summer-bee,--
    Fit that I be plucked for thee!

    XXVII.

    Yet who plucks me?--no one mourns,
      I have lived my season out,
    And now die of my own thorns
      Which I could not live without.
    Sweet, be merry! How the light
    Comes and goes! If it be night,
    Keep the candles in my sight.

    XXVIII.

    Are there footsteps at the door?
      Look out quickly. Yea, or nay?
    Some one might be waiting for
      Some last word that I might say.
    Nay? So best!--so angels would
    Stand off clear from deathly road,
    Not to cross the sight of God.

    XXIX.

    Colder grow my hands and feet.
      When I wear the shroud I made,
    Let the folds lie straight and neat,
      And the rosemary be spread,
    That if any friend should come,
    (To see thee, Sweet!) all the room
    May be lifted out of gloom.

    XXX.

    And, dear Bertha, let me keep
      On my hand this little ring,
    Which at nights, when others sleep,
      I can still see glittering!
    Let me wear it out of sight,
    In the grave,--where it will light
    All the dark up, day and night.

    XXXI.

    On that grave drop not a tear!
      Else, though fathom-deep the place,
    Through the woollen shroud I wear
      I shall feel it on my face.
    Rather smile there, blessèd one,
    Thinking of me in the sun,
    Or forget me--smiling on!

    XXXII.

    Art thou near me? nearer! so--
      Kiss me close upon the eyes,
    That the earthly light may go
      Sweetly, as it used to rise
    When I watched the morning-grey
    Strike, betwixt the hills, the way
    He was sure to come that day.

    XXXIII.

    So,--no more vain words be said!
      The hosannas nearer roll.
    Mother, smile now on thy Dead,
      I am death-strong in my soul.
    Mystic Dove alit on cross,
    Guide the poor bird of the snows
    Through the snow-wind above loss!

    XXXIV.

    Jesus, Victim, comprehending
      Love's divine self-abnegation,
    Cleanse my love in its self-spending,
      And absorb the poor libation!
    Wind my thread of life up higher,
    Up, through angels' hands of fire!
    I aspire while I expire.




LADY GERALDINE'S COURTSHIP:

A ROMANCE OF THE AGE.

A Poet writes to his Friend. PLACE--A Room in Wycombe Hall.
TIME--Late in the evening.


    I.

    Dear my friend and fellow-student, I would lean my spirit o'er you!
    Down the purple of this chamber tears should scarcely run at will.
    I am humbled who was humble. Friend, I bow my head before you:
    You should lead me to my peasants, but their faces are too still.

    II.

    There's a lady, an earl's daughter,--she is proud and she is noble,
    And she treads the crimson carpet and she breathes the perfumed air,
    And a kingly blood sends glances up, her princely eye to trouble,
    And the shadow of a monarch's crown is softened in her hair.

    III.

    She has halls among the woodlands, she has castles by the breakers,
    She has farms and she has manors, she can threaten and command:
    And the palpitating engines snort in steam across her acres,
    As they mark upon the blasted heaven the measure of the land.

    IV.

    There are none of England's daughters who can show a prouder presence;
    Upon princely suitors' praying she has looked in her disdain.
    She was sprung of English nobles, I was born of English peasants;
    What was I that I should love her, save for competence to pain?

    V.

    I was only a poor poet, made for singing at her casement,
    As the finches or the thrushes, while she thought of other things.
    Oh, she walked so high above me, she appeared to my abasement,
    In her lovely silken murmur, like an angel clad in wings!

    VI.

    Many vassals bow before her as her carriage sweeps their doorways;
    She has blest their little children, as a priest or queen were she:
    Far too tender, or too cruel far, her smile upon the poor was,
    For I thought it was the same smile which she used to smile on me.

    VII.

    She has voters in the Commons, she has lovers in the palace,
    And, of all the fair court-ladies, few have jewels half as fine;
    Oft the Prince has named her beauty 'twixt the red wine and the
        chalice:
    Oh, and what was I to love her? my beloved, my Geraldine!

    VIII.

    Yet I could not choose but love her: I was born to poet-uses,
    To love all things set above me, all of good and all of fair.
    Nymphs of mountain, not of valley, we are wont to call the Muses;
    And in nympholeptic climbing, poets pass from mount to star.

    IX.

    And because I was a poet, and because the public praised me,
    With a critical deduction for the modern writer's fault,
    I could sit at rich men's tables,--though the courtesies that raised
        me,
    Still suggested clear between us the pale spectrum of the salt.

    X.

    And they praised me in her presence--"Will your book appear this
        summer?"
    Then returning to each other--"Yes, our plans are for the moors."
    Then with whisper dropped behind me--"There he is! the latest comer.
    Oh, she only likes his verses! what is over, she endures.

    XI.

    "Quite low-born, self-educated! somewhat gifted though by nature,
    And we make a point of asking him,--of being very kind.
    You may speak, he does not hear you! and, besides, he writes no
        satire,--
    All these serpents kept by charmers leave the natural sting behind."

    XII.

    I grew scornfuller, grew colder, as I stood up there among them,
    Till as frost intense will burn you, the cold scorning scorched my
        brow;
    When a sudden silver speaking, gravely cadenced, over-rung them,
    And a sudden silken stirring touched my inner nature through.

    XIII.

    I looked upward and beheld her: with a calm and regnant spirit,
    Slowly round she swept her eyelids, and said clear before them all--
    "Have you such superfluous honour, sir, that able to confer it
    You will come down, Mister Bertram, as my guest to Wycombe Hall?"

    XIV.

    Here she paused; she had been paler at the first word of her speaking,
    But, because a silence followed it, blushed somewhat, as for shame:
    Then, as scorning her own feeling, resumed calmly--"I am seeking
    More distinction than these gentlemen think worthy of my claim.

    XV.

    "Ne'ertheless, you see, I seek it--not because I am a woman,"
    (Here her smile sprang like a fountain and, so, overflowed her mouth)
    "But because my woods in Sussex have some purple shades at gloaming
    Which are worthy of a king in state, or poet in his youth.

    XVI.

    "I invite you, Mister Bertram, to no scene for worldly speeches--
    Sir, I scarce should dare--but only where God asked the thrushes first:
    And if you will sing beside them, in the covert of my beeches,
    I will thank you for the woodlands,--for the human world, at worst."

    XVII.

    Then she smiled around right childly, then she gazed around right
        queenly,
    And I bowed--I could not answer; alternated light and gloom--
    While as one who quells the lions, with a steady eye serenely,
    She, with level fronting eyelids, passed out stately from the room.

    XVIII.

    Oh, the blessèd woods of Sussex, I can hear them still around me,
    With their leafy tide of greenery still rippling up the wind!
    Oh, the cursèd woods of Sussex! where the hunter's arrow found me,
    When a fair face and a tender voice had made me mad and blind!

    XIX.

    In that ancient hall of Wycombe thronged the numerous guests invited,
    And the lovely London ladies trod the floors with gliding feet;
    And their voices low with fashion, not with feeling, softly freighted
    All the air about the windows with elastic laughters sweet.

    XX.

    For at eve the open windows flung their light out on the terrace
    Which the floating orbs of curtains did with gradual shadow sweep,
    While the swans upon the river, fed at morning by the heiress,
    Trembled downward through their snowy wings at music in their sleep.

    XXI.

    And there evermore was music, both of instrument and singing,
    Till the finches of the shrubberies grew restless in the dark;
    But the cedars stood up motionless, each in a moonlight's ringing,
    And the deer, half in the glimmer, strewed the hollows of the park.

    XXII.

    And though sometimes she would bind me with her silver-corded speeches
    To commix my words and laughter with the converse and the jest,
    Oft I sat apart and, gazing on the river through the beeches,
    Heard, as pure the swans swam down it, her pure voice o'erfloat the
        rest.

    XXIII.

    In the morning, horn of huntsman, hoof of steed and laugh of rider,
    Spread out cheery from the courtyard till we lost them in the hills,
    While herself and other ladies, and her suitors left beside her,
    Went a-wandering up the gardens through the laurels and abeles.

    XXIV.

    Thus, her foot upon the new-mown grass, bareheaded, with the flowing
    Of the virginal white vesture gathered closely to her throat,
    And the golden ringlets in her neck just quickened by her going,
    And appearing to breathe sun for air, and doubting if to float,--

    XXV.

    With a bunch of dewy maple, which her right hand held above her,
    And which trembled a green shadow in betwixt her and the skies,
    As she turned her face in going, thus, she drew me on to love her,
    And to worship the divineness of the smile hid in her eyes.

    XXVI.

    For her eyes alone smile constantly; her lips have serious sweetness,
    And her front is calm, the dimple rarely ripples on the cheek;
    But her deep blue eyes smile constantly, as if they in discreetness
    Kept the secret of a happy dream she did not care to speak.

    XXVII.

    Thus she drew me the first morning, out across into the garden,
    And I walked among her noble friends and could not keep behind.
    Spake she unto all and unto me--"Behold, I am the warden
    Of the song-birds in these lindens, which are cages to their mind.

    XXVIII.

    "But within this swarded circle into which the lime-walk brings us,
    Whence the beeches, rounded greenly, stand away in reverent fear,
    I will let no music enter, saving what the fountain sings us
    Which the lilies round the basin may seem pure enough to hear.

    XXIX.

    "The live air that waves the lilies waves the slender jet of water
    Like a holy thought sent feebly up from soul of fasting saint:
    Whereby lies a marble Silence, sleeping (Lough the sculptor wrought
        her),
    So asleep she is forgetting to say Hush!--a fancy quaint.

    XXX.

    "Mark how heavy white her eyelids! not a dream between them lingers;
    And the left hand's index droppeth from the lips upon the cheek:
    While the right hand,--with the symbol-rose held slack within the
        fingers,--
    Has fallen backward in the basin--yet this Silence will not speak!

    XXXI.

    "That the essential meaning growing may exceed the special symbol,
    Is the thought as I conceive it: it applies more high and low.
    Our true noblemen will often through right nobleness grow humble,
    And assert an inward honour by denying outward show."

    XXXII.

    "Nay, your Silence," said I, "truly, holds her symbol-rose but slackly,
    Yet she holds it, or would scarcely be a Silence to our ken:
    And your nobles wear their ermine on the outside, or walk blackly
    In the presence of the social law as mere ignoble men.

    XXXIII.

    "Let the poets dream such dreaming! madam, in these British islands
    'T is the substance that wanes ever, 't is the symbol that exceeds.
    Soon we shall have nought but symbol: and, for statues like this
        Silence,
    Shall accept the rose's image--in another case, the weed's."

    XXXIV.

    "Not so quickly," she retorted,--"I confess, where'er you go, you
    Find for things, names--shows for actions, and pure gold for honour
        clear:
    But when all is run to symbol in the Social, I will throw you
    The world's book which now reads dryly, and sit down with Silence
        here."

    XXXV.

    Half in playfulness she spoke, I thought, and half in indignation;
    Friends, who listened, laughed her words off, while her lovers deemed
        her fair:
    A fair woman, flushed with feeling, in her noble-lighted station
    Near the statue's white reposing--and both bathed in sunny air!

    XXXVI.

    With the trees round, not so distant but you heard their vernal murmur,
    And beheld in light and shadow the leaves in and outward move,
    And the little fountain leaping toward the sun-heart to be warmer,
    Then recoiling in a tremble from the too much light above.

    XXXVII.

    'T is a picture for remembrance. And thus, morning after morning,
    Did I follow as she drew me by the spirit to her feet.
    Why, her greyhound followed also! dogs--we both were dogs for
        scorning--
    To be sent back when she pleased it and her path lay through the wheat.

    XXXVIII.

    And thus, morning after morning, spite of vows and spite of sorrow,
    Did I follow at her drawing, while the week-days passed along,--
    Just to feed the swans this noontide, or to see the fawns to-morrow,
    Or to teach the hill-side echo some sweet Tuscan in a song.

    XXXIX.

    Ay, for sometimes on the hill-side, while we sate down in the gowans,
    With the forest green behind us and its shadow cast before,
    And the river running under, and across it from the rowans
    A brown partridge whirring near us till we felt the air it bore,--

    XL.

    There, obedient to her praying, did I read aloud the poems
    Made to Tuscan flutes, or instruments more various of our own;
    Read the pastoral parts of Spenser, or the subtle interflowings
    Found in Petrarch's sonnets--here's the book, the leaf is folded down!

    XLI.

    Or at times a modern volume, Wordsworth's solemn-thoughted idyl,
    Howitt's ballad-verse, or Tennyson's enchanted reverie,--
    Or from Browning some "Pomegranate," which, if cut deep down the
        middle,
    Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity.

    XLII.

    Or at times I read there, hoarsely, some new poem of my making:
    Poets ever fail in reading their own verses to their worth,
    For the echo in you breaks upon the words which you are speaking,
    And the chariot wheels jar in the gate through which you drive them
        forth.

    XLIII.

    After, when we were grown tired of books, the silence round us flinging
    A slow arm of sweet compression, felt with beatings at the breast
    She would break out on a sudden in a gush of woodland singing,
    Like a child's emotion in a god--a naiad tired of rest.

    XLIV.

    Oh, to see or hear her singing! scarce I know which is divinest,
    For her looks sing too--she modulates her gestures on the tune,
    And her mouth stirs with the song, like song; and when the notes are
        finest,
    'T is the eyes that shoot out vocal light and seem to swell them on.

    XLV.

    Then we talked--oh, how we talked! her voice, so cadenced in the
        talking,
    Made another singing--of the soul! a music without bars:
    While the leafy sounds of woodlands, humming round where we were
        walking,
    Brought interposition worthy-sweet,--as skies about the stars.

    XLVI.

    And she spake such good thoughts natural, as if she always thought
        them;
    She had sympathies so rapid, open, free as bird on branch,
    Just as ready to fly east as west, whichever way besought them,
    In the birchen-wood a chirrup, or a cock-crow in the grange.

    XLVII.

    In her utmost lightness there is truth--and often she speaks lightly,
    Has a grace in being gay which even mournful souls approve,
    For the root of some grave earnest thought is understruck so rightly
    As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above.

    XLVIII.

    And she talked on--we talked, rather! upon all things, substance,
        shadow,
    Of the sheep that browsed the grasses, of the reapers in the corn,
    Of the little children from the schools, seen winding through the
        meadow,
    Of the poor rich world beyond them, still kept poorer by its scorn.

    XLIX.

    So, of men, and so, of letters--books are men of higher stature,
    And the only men that speak aloud for future times to hear;
    So, of mankind in the abstract, which grows slowly into nature,
    Yet will lift the cry of "progress," as it trod from sphere to sphere.

    L.

    And her custom was to praise me when I said,--"The Age culls simples,
    With a broad clown's back turned broadly to the glory of the stars.
    We are gods by our own reck'ning, and may well shut up the temples,
    And wield on, amid the incense-steam, the thunder of our cars.

    LI.

    "For we throw out acclamations of self-thanking, self admiring,
    With, at every mile run faster,--'O the wondrous wondrous age!'
    Little thinking if we work our SOULS as nobly as our iron,
    Or if angels will commend us at the goal of pilgrimage.

    LII.

    "Why, what is this patient entrance into nature's deep resources
    But the child's most gradual learning to walk upright without bane?
    When we drive out, from the cloud of steam, majestical white horses,
    Are we greater than the first men who led black ones by the mane?

    LIII.

    "If we trod the deeps of ocean, if we struck the stars in rising,
    If we wrapped the globe intensely with one hot electric breath,
    'T were but power within our tether, no new spirit-power comprising,
    And in life we were not greater men, nor bolder men in death."

    LIV.

    She was patient with my talking; and I loved her, loved her certes
    As I loved all heavenly objects, with uplifted eyes and hands;
    As I loved pure inspirations, loved the graces, loved the virtues,
    In a Love content with writing his own name on desert sands.

    LV.

    Or at least I thought so, purely; thought no idiot Hope was raising
    Any crown to crown Love's silence, silent Love that sate alone:
    Out, alas! the stag is like me, he that tries to go on grazing
    With the great deep gun-wound in his neck, then reels with sudden moan.

    LVI.

    It was thus I reeled. I told you that her hand had many suitors;
    But she smiles them down imperially as Venus did the waves,
    And with such a gracious coldness that they cannot press their futures
    On the present of her courtesy, which yieldingly enslaves.

    LVII.

    And this morning as I sat alone within the inner chamber
    With the great saloon beyond it, lost in pleasant thought serene,
    For I had been reading Camoëns, that poem you remember,
    Which his lady's eyes are praised in as the sweetest ever seen.

    LVIII.

    And the book lay open, and my thought flew from it, taking from it
    A vibration and impulsion to an end beyond its own,
    As the branch of a green osier, when a child would overcome it,
    Springs up freely from his claspings and goes swinging in the sun.

    LIX.

    As I mused I heard a murmur; it grew deep as it grew longer,
    Speakers using earnest language--"Lady Geraldine, you would!"
    And I heard a voice that pleaded, ever on in accents stronger,
    As a sense of reason gave it power to make its rhetoric good.

    LX.

    Well I knew that voice; it was an earl's, of soul that matched his
        station,
    Soul completed into lordship, might and right read on his brow;
    Very finely courteous; far too proud to doubt his domination
    Of the common people, he atones for grandeur by a bow.

    LXI.

    High straight forehead, nose of eagle, cold blue eyes of less
        expression
    Than resistance, coldly casting off the looks of other men,
    As steel, arrows; unelastic lips which seem to taste possession
    And be cautious lest the common air should injure or distrain.

    LXII.

    For the rest, accomplished, upright,--ay, and standing by his order
    With a bearing not ungraceful; fond of art and letters too;
    Just a good man made a proud man,--as the sandy rocks that border
    A wild coast, by circumstances, in a regnant ebb and flow.

    LXIII.

    Thus, I knew that voice, I heard it, and I could not help the
        hearkening:
    In the room I stood up blindly, and my burning heart within
    Seemed to seethe and fuse my senses till they ran on all sides
        darkening,
    And scorched, weighed like melted metal round my feet that stood
        therein.

    LXIV.

    And that voice, I heard it pleading, for love's sake, for wealth,
        position,
    For the sake of liberal uses and great actions to be done:
    And she interrupted gently, "Nay, my lord, the old tradition
    Of your Normans, by some worthier hand than mine is, should be won."

    LXV.

    "Ah, that white hand!" he said quickly,--and in his he either drew it
    Or attempted--for with gravity and instance she replied,
    "Nay, indeed, my lord, this talk is vain, and we had best eschew it
    And pass on, like friends, to other points less easy to decide."

    LXVI.

    What he said again, I know not: it is likely that his trouble
    Worked his pride up to the surface, for she answered in slow scorn,
    "And your lordship judges rightly. Whom I marry shall be noble,
    Ay, and wealthy. I shall never blush to think how he was born."

    LXVII.

    There, I maddened! her words stung me. Life swept through me into
        fever,
    And my soul sprang up astonished, sprang full-statured in an hour.
    Know you what it is when anguish, with apocalyptic NEVER,
    To a Pythian height dilates you, and despair sublimes to power?

    LXVIII.

    From my brain the soul-wings budded, waved a flame about my body,
    Whence conventions coiled to ashes. I felt self-drawn out, as man,
    From amalgamate false natures, and I saw the skies grow ruddy
    With the deepening feet of angels, and I knew what spirits can.

    LXIX.

    I was mad, inspired--say either! (anguish worketh inspiration)
    Was a man or beast--perhaps so, for the tiger roars when speared;
    And I walked on, step by step along the level of my passion--
    Oh my soul! and passed the doorway to her face, and never feared.

    LXX.

    He had left her, peradventure, when my footstep proved my coming,
    But for her--she half arose, then sate, grew scarlet and grew pale.
    Oh, she trembled! 't is so always with a worldly man or woman
    In the presence of true spirits; what else can they do but quail?

    LXXI.

    Oh, she fluttered like a tame bird, in among its forest-brothers
    Far too strong for it; then drooping, bowed her face upon her hands;
    And I spake out wildly, fiercely, brutal truths of her and others:
    I, she planted in the desert, swathed her, windlike, with my sands.

    LXXII.

    I plucked up her social fictions, bloody-rooted though leaf-verdant,
    Trod them down with words of shaming,--all the purple and the gold.
    All the "landed stakes" and lordships, all that spirits pure and ardent
    Are cast out of love and honour because chancing not to hold.

    LXXIII.

    "For myself I do not argue," said I, "though I love you, madam,
    But for better souls that nearer to the height of yours have trod:
    And this age shows, to my thinking, still more infidels to Adam
    Than directly, by profession, simple infidels to God.

    LXXIV.

    "Yet, O God," I said, "O grave," I said, "O mother's heart and bosom,
    With whom first and last are equal, saint and corpse and little child!
    We are fools to your deductions, in these figments of heart-closing;
    We are traitors to your causes, in these sympathies defiled.

    LXXV.

    "Learn more reverence, madam, not for rank or wealth--that needs no
        learning:
    That comes quickly, quick as sin does, ay, and culminates to sin;
    But for Adam's seed, MAN! Trust me, 't is a clay above your scorning,
    With God's image stamped upon it, and God's kindling breath within.

    LXXVI.

    "What right have you, madam, gazing in your palace mirror daily,
    Getting so by heart your beauty which all others must adore,
    While you draw the golden ringlets down your fingers, to vow gaily
    You will wed no man that's only good to God, and nothing more?

    LXXVII.

    "Why, what right have you, made fair by that same God, the sweetest
        woman
    Of all women He has fashioned, with your lovely spirit-face
    Which would seem too near to vanish if its smile were not so human,
    And your voice of holy sweetness, turning common words to grace,--

    LXXVIII.

    "What right can you have, God's other works to scorn, despise, revile
        them
    In the gross, as mere men, broadly--not as noble men, forsooth,--
    As mere Pariahs of the outer world, forbidden to assoil them
    In the hope of living, dying, near that sweetness of your mouth?

    LXXIX.

    "Have you any answer, madam? If my spirit were less earthly,
    If its instrument were gifted with a better silver string,
    I would kneel down where I stand, and say--Behold me! I am worthy
    Of thy loving, for I love thee. I am worthy as a king.

    LXXX.

    "As it is--your ermined pride, I swear, shall feel this stain upon her,
    That I, poor, weak, tost with passion, scorned by me and you again,
    Love you, madam, dare to love you, to my grief and your dishonour,
    To my endless desolation, and your impotent disdain!"

    LXXXI.

    More mad words like these--mere madness! friend, I need not write them
        fuller,
    For I hear my hot soul dropping on the lines in showers of tears.
    Oh, a woman! friend, a woman! why, a beast had scarce been duller
    Than roar bestial loud complaints against the shining of the spheres.

    LXXXII.

    But at last there came a pause. I stood all vibrating with thunder
    Which my soul had used. The silence drew her face up like a call.
    Could you guess what word she uttered? She looked up, as if in wonder,
    With tears beaded on her lashes, and said--"Bertram!"--It was all.

    LXXXIII.

    If she had cursed me, and she might have, or if even, with queenly
        bearing
    Which at need is used by women, she had risen up and said,
    "Sir, you are my guest, and therefore I have given you a full hearing:
    Now, beseech you, choose a name exacting somewhat less, instead!"--

    LXXXIV.

    I had borne it: but that "Bertram"--why, it lies there on the paper
    A mere word, without her accent, and you cannot judge the weight
    Of the calm which crushed my passion: I seemed drowning in a vapour;
    And her gentleness destroyed me whom her scorn made desolate.

    LXXXV.

    So, struck backward and exhausted by that inward flow of passion
    Which had rushed on, sparing nothing, into forms of abstract truth,
    By a logic agonizing through unseemly demonstration,
    And by youth's own anguish turning grimly grey the hairs of youth,--

    LXXXVI.

    By the sense accursed and instant, that if even I spake wisely
    I spake basely--using truth, if what I spake indeed was true,
    To avenge wrong on a woman--her, who sate there weighing nicely
    A poor manhood's worth, found guilty of such deeds as I could do!--

    LXXXVII.

    By such wrong and woe exhausted--what I suffered and occasioned,--
    As a wild horse through a city runs with lightning in his eyes,
    And then dashing at a church's cold and passive wall, impassioned,
    Strikes the death into his burning brain, and blindly drops and dies--

    LXXXVIII.

    So I fell, struck down before her--do you blame me, friend, for
        weakness?
    'T was my strength of passion slew me!--fell before her like a stone;
    Fast the dreadful world rolled from me on its roaring wheels of
        blackness:
    When the light came I was lying in this chamber and alone.

    LXXXIX.

    Oh, of course she charged her lacqueys to bear out the sickly burden,
    And to cast it from her scornful sight, but not beyond the gate;
    She is too kind to be cruel, and too haughty not to pardon
    Such a man as I; 't were something to be level to her hate.

    XC.

    But for me--you now are conscious why, my friend, I write this letter,
    How my life is read all backward, and the charm of life undone.
    I shall leave her house at dawn; I would to-night, if I were better--
    And I charge my soul to hold my body strengthened for the sun.

    XCI.

    When the sun has dyed the oriel, I depart, with no last gazes,
    No weak moanings (one word only, left in writing for her hands),
    Out of reach of all derision, and some unavailing praises,
    To make front against this anguish in the far and foreign lands.

    XCII.

    Blame me not. I would not squander life in grief--I am abstemious.
    I but nurse my spirit's falcon that its wing may soar again.
    There's no room for tears of weakness in the blind eyes of a Phemius:
    Into work the poet kneads them, and he does not die till then.


    CONCLUSION.

    I.

    Bertram finished the last pages, while along the silence ever
    Still in hot and heavy splashes fell the tears on every leaf.
    Having ended, he leans backward in his chair, with lips that quiver
    From the deep unspoken, ay, and deep unwritten thoughts of grief.

    II.

    Soh! how still the lady standeth! 'T is a dream--a dream of mercies!
    'Twixt the purple lattice-curtains how she standeth still and pale!
    'T is a vision, sure, of mercies, sent to soften his self curses,
    Sent to sweep a patient quiet o'er the tossing of his wail.

    III.

    "Eyes," he said, "now throbbing through me! are ye eyes that did undo
        me?
    Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone!
    Underneath that calm white forehead are ye ever burning torrid
    O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?"

    IV.

    With a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air the purple curtain
    Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows,
    While the gliding of the river sends a rippling noise for ever
    Through the open casement whitened by the moonlight's slant repose.

    V.

    Said he--"Vision of a lady! stand there silent, stand there steady!
    Now I see it plainly, plainly now I cannot hope or doubt--
    There, the brows of mild repression--there, the lips of silent passion,
    Curvèd like an archer's bow to send the bitter arrows out."

    VI.

    Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling,
    And approached him slowly, slowly, in a gliding measured pace;
    With her two white hands extended as if praying one offended,
    And a look of supplication gazing earnest in his face.

    VII.

    Said he--"Wake me by no gesture,--sound of breath, or stir of vesture!
    Let the blessèd apparition melt not yet to its divine!
    No approaching--hush, no breathing! or my heart must swoon to death in
    The too utter life thou bringest, O thou dream of Geraldine!"

    VIII.

    Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling,
    But the tears ran over lightly from her eyes and tenderly:--
    "Dost thou, Bertram, truly love me? Is no woman far above me
    Found more worthy of thy poet-heart than such a one as I?"

    IX.

    Said he--"I would dream so ever, like the flowing of that river,
    Flowing ever in a shadow greenly onward to the sea!
    So, thou vision of all sweetness, princely to a full completeness
    Would my heart and life flow onward, deathward, through this dream of
        THEE!"

    X.

    Ever, evermore the while in a slow silence she kept smiling,
    While the silver tears ran faster down the blushing of her cheeks;
    Then with both her hands enfolding both of his, she softly told him,
    "Bertram, if I say I love thee, ... 't is the vision only speaks."

    XI.

    Softened, quickened to adore her, on his knee he fell before her,
    And she whispered low in triumph, "It shall be as I have sworn.
    Very rich he is in virtues, very noble--noble, certes;
    And I shall not blush in knowing that men call him lowly born."




THE RUNAWAY SLAVE AT PILGRIM'S POINT.


    I.

    I stand on the mark beside the shore
      Of the first white pilgrim's bended knee,
    Where exile turned to ancestor,
      And God was thanked for liberty.
    I have run through the night, my skin is as dark,
    I bend my knee down on this mark:
      I look on the sky and the sea.

    II.

    O pilgrim-souls, I speak to you!
      I see you come proud and slow
    From the land of the spirits pale as dew
      And round me and round me ye go.
    O pilgrims, I have gasped and run
    All night long from the whips of one
      Who in your names works sin and woe!

    III.

    And thus I thought that I would come
      And kneel here where ye knelt before,
    And feel your souls around me hum
      In undertone to the ocean's roar;
    And lift my black face, my black hand,
    Here, in your names, to curse this land
      Ye blessed in freedom's, evermore.

    IV.

    I am black, I am black,
      And yet God made me, they say:
    But if He did so, smiling back
      He must have cast his work away
    Under the feet of his white creatures,
    With a look of scorn, that the dusky features
      Might be trodden again to clay.

    V.

    And yet He has made dark things
      To be glad and merry as light:
    There's a little dark bird sits and sings,
      There's a dark stream ripples out of sight,
    And the dark frogs chant in the safe morass,
    And the sweetest stars are made to pass
      O'er the face of the darkest night.

    VI.

    But we who are dark, we are dark!
      Ah God, we have no stars!
    About our souls in care and cark
      Our blackness shuts like prison-bars:
    The poor souls crouch so far behind
    That never a comfort can they find
      By reaching through the prison-bars.

    VII.

    Indeed we live beneath the sky,
      That great smooth Hand of God stretched out
    On all His children fatherly,
      To save them from the dread and doubt
    Which would be if, from this low place,
    All opened straight up to His face
      Into the grand eternity.

    VIII.

    And still God's sunshine and His frost,
      They make us hot, they make us cold,
    As if we were not black and lost;
      And the beasts and birds, in wood and fold,
    Do fear and take us for very men:
    Could the whip-poor-will or the cat of the glen
      Look into my eyes and be bold?

    IX.

    I am black, I am black!
      But, once, I laughed in girlish glee,
    For one of my colour stood in the track
      Where the drivers drove, and looked at me,
    And tender and full was the look he gave--
    Could a slave look so at another slave?--
      I look at the sky and the sea.

    X.

    And from that hour our spirits grew
      As free as if unsold, unbought:
    Oh, strong enough, since we were two,
      To conquer the world, we thought.
    The drivers drove us day by day;
    We did not mind, we went one way,
      And no better a freedom sought.

    XI.

    In the sunny ground between the canes,
      He said "I love you" as he passed;
    When the shingle-roof rang sharp with the rains,
      I heard how he vowed it fast:
    While others shook he smiled in the hut,
    As he carved me a bowl of the cocoa-nut
      Through the roar of the hurricanes.

    XII.

    I sang his name instead of a song,
      Over and over I sang his name,
    Upward and downward I drew it along
      My various notes,--the same, the same!
    I sang it low, that the slave-girls near
    Might never guess, from aught they could hear,
      It was only a name--a name.

    XIII.

    I look on the sky and the sea.
      We were two to love, and two to pray:
    Yes, two, O God, who cried to Thee,
      Though nothing didst Thou say!
    Coldly Thou sat'st behind the sun:
    And now I cry who am but one,
      Thou wilt not speak to-day.

    XIV.

    We were black, we were black,
      We had no claim to love and bliss,
    What marvel if each went to wrack?
      They wrung my cold hands out of his,
    They dragged him--where? I crawled to touch
    His blood's mark in the dust ... not much,
      Ye pilgrim-souls, though plain as this!

    XV.

    Wrong, followed by a deeper wrong!
      Mere grief's too good for such as I:
    So the white men brought the shame ere long
      To strangle the sob of my agony.
    They would not leave me for my dull
    Wet eyes!--it was too merciful
      To let me weep pure tears and die.

    XVI.

    I am black, I am black!
      I wore a child upon my breast,
    An amulet that hung too slack,
      And, in my unrest, could not rest:
    Thus we went moaning, child and mother,
    One to another, one to another,
      Until all ended for the best.

    XVII.

    For hark! I will tell you low, low,
      I am black, you see,--
    And the babe who lay on my bosom so,
      Was far too white, too white for me;
    As white as the ladies who scorned to pray
    Beside me at church but yesterday,
      Though my tears had washed a place for my knee.

    XVIII.

    My own, own child! I could not bear
      To look in his face, it was so white;
    I covered him up with a kerchief there,
      I covered his face in close and tight:
    And he moaned and struggled, as well might be,
    For the white child wanted his liberty--
      Ha, ha! he wanted the master-right.

    XIX.

    He moaned and beat with his head and feet,
      His little feet that never grew;
    He struck them out, as it was meet,
      Against my heart to break it through:
    I might have sung and made him mild,
    But I dared not sing to the white-faced child
      The only song I knew.

    XX.

    I pulled the kerchief very close:
      He could not see the sun, I swear,
    More, then, alive, than now he does
      From between the roots of the mango ... where?
    I know where. Close! A child and mother
    Do wrong to look at one another
      When one is black and one is fair.

    XXI.

    Why, in that single glance I had
      Of my child's face, ... I tell you all,
    I saw a look that made me mad!
      The master's look, that used to fall
    On my soul like his lash ... or worse!
    And so, to save it from my curse,
      I twisted it round in my shawl.

    XXII.

    And he moaned and trembled from foot to head,
      He shivered from head to foot;
    Till after a time, he lay instead
      Too suddenly still and mute.
    I felt, beside, a stiffening cold:
    I dared to lift up just a fold,
      As in lifting a leaf of the mango-fruit.

    XXIII.

    But my fruit ... ha, ha!--there, had been
      (I laugh to think on 't at this hour!)
    Your fine white angels (who have seen
      Nearest the secret of God's power)
    And plucked my fruit to make them wine,
    And sucked the soul of that child of mine
      As the humming-bird sucks the soul of the flower.

    XXIV.

    Ha, ha, the trick of the angels white!
      They freed the white child's spirit so.
    I said not a word, but day and night
      I carried the body to and fro,
    And it lay on my heart like a stone, as chill.
    --The sun may shine out as much as he will:
      I am cold, though it happened a month ago.

    XXV.

    From the white man's house, and the black man's hut,
      I carried the little body on;
    The forest's arms did round us shut,
      And silence through the trees did run:
    They asked no question as I went,
    They stood too high for astonishment,
      They could see God sit on his throne.

    XXVI.

    My little body, kerchiefed fast,
      I bore it on through the forest, on;
    And when I felt it was tired at last,
      I scooped a hole beneath the moon:
    Through the forest-tops the angels far,
    With a white sharp finger from every star,
      Did point and mock at what was done.

    XXVII.

    Yet when it was all done aught,--
      Earth, 'twixt me and my baby, strewed,--
    All, changed to black earth,--nothing white,--
      A dark child in the dark!--ensued
    Some comfort, and my heart grew young;
    I sate down smiling there and sung
      The song I learnt in my maidenhood.

    XXVIII.

    And thus we two were reconciled,
      The white child and black mother, thus;
    For as I sang it soft and wild,
      The same song, more melodious,
    Rose from the grave whereon I sate
    It was the dead child singing that,
      To join the souls of both of us.

    XXIX.

    I look on the sea and the sky.
      Where the pilgrims' ships first anchored lay
    The free sun rideth gloriously,
      But the pilgrim-ghosts have slid away
    Through the earliest streaks of the morn:
    My face is black, but it glares with a scorn
      Which they dare not meet by day.

    XXX.

    Ha!--in their stead, their hunter sons!
      Ha, ha! they are on me--they hunt in a ring!
    Keep off! I brave you all at once,
      I throw off your eyes like snakes that sting!
    You have killed the black eagle at nest, I think:
    Did you ever stand still in your triumph, and shrink
      From the stroke of her wounded wing?

    XXXI.

    (Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!--)
      I wish you who stand there five abreast.
    Each, for his own wife's joy and gift,
      A little corpse as safely at rest
    As mine in the mangoes! Yes, but she
    May keep live babies on her knee,
      And sing the song she likes the best.

    XXXII.

    I am not mad: I am black.
      I see you staring in my face--
    I know you staring, shrinking back,
      Ye are born of the Washington-race,
    And this land is the free America,
    And this mark on my wrist--(I prove what I say)
      Ropes tied me up here to the flogging-place.

    XXXIII.

    You think I shrieked then? Not a sound!
      I hung, as a gourd hangs in the sun;
    I only cursed them all around
      As softly as I might have done
    My very own child: from these sands
    Up to the mountains, lift your hands,
      O slaves, and end what I begun!

    XXXIV.

    Whips, curses; these must answer those!
      For in this UNION you have set
    Two kinds of men in adverse rows,
      Each loathing each; and all forget
    The seven wounds in Christ's body fair,
    While HE sees gaping everywhere
      Our countless wounds that pay no debt.

    XXXV.

    Our wounds are different. Your white men
      Are, after all, not gods indeed,
    Nor able to make Christs again
      Do good with bleeding. We who bleed
    (Stand off!) we help not in our loss!
    We are too heavy for our cross,
      And fall and crush you and your seed.

    XXXVI.

    I fall, I swoon! I look at the sky.
      The clouds are breaking on my brain
    I am floated along, as if I should die
      Of liberty's exquisite pain.
    In the name of the white child waiting for me
    In the death-dark where we may kiss and agree,
    White men, I leave you all curse-free
      In my broken heart's disdain!




THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN.

    ~"Pheu, pheu, ti prosderkesthe m' ommasin, tekna?"~

    --Medea.


    I.

    Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
        Ere the sorrow comes with years?
    They are leaning their young heads against their mothers.
        And that cannot stop their tears.
    The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,
      The young birds are chirping in the nest,
    The young fawns are playing with the shadows,
      The young flowers are blowing toward the west--
    But the young, young children, O my brothers,
        They are weeping bitterly!
    They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
        In the country of the free.

    II.

    Do you question the young children in the sorrow
        Why their tears are falling so?
    The old man may weep for his to-morrow
        Which is lost in Long Ago;
    The old tree is leafless in the forest,
      The old year is ending in the frost,
    The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest,
      The old hope is hardest to be lost:
    But the young, young children, O my brothers,
        Do you ask them why they stand
    Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
        In our happy Fatherland?

    III.

    They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
        And their looks are sad to see,
    For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses
        Down the cheeks of infancy;
    "Your old earth," they say, "is very dreary,
      Our young feet," they say, "are very weak;
    Few paces have we taken, yet are weary--
      Our grave-rest is very far to seek:
    Ask the aged why they weep, and not the children,
        For the outside earth is cold,
    And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,
        And the graves are for the old."

    IV.

    "True," say the children, "it may happen
        That we die before our time:
    Little Alice died last year, her grave is shapen
        Like a snowball, in the rime.
    We looked into the pit prepared to take her:
      Was no room for any work in the close clay!
    From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,
      Crying, 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'
    If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,
      With your ear down, little Alice never cries;
    Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,
      For the smile has time for growing in her eyes:
    And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in
        The shroud by the kirk-chime.
    It is good when it happens," say the children,
        "That we die before our time."

    V.

    Alas, alas, the children! they are seeking
        Death in life, as best to have:
    They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,
        With a cerement from the grave.
    Go out, children, from the mine and from the city,
      Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do;
    Pluck your handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty,
      Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through!
    But they answer, "Are your cowslips of the meadows
        Like our weeds anear the mine?
    Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,
        From your pleasures fair and fine!

    VI.

    "For oh," say the children, "we are weary,
        And we cannot run or leap;
    If we cared for any meadows, it were merely
        To drop down in them and sleep.
    Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,
      We fall upon our faces, trying to go;
    And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,
      The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.
    For, all day, we drag our burden tiring
        Through the coal-dark, underground;
    Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron
        In the factories, round and round.

    VII.

    "For all day the wheels are droning, turning;
        Their wind comes in our faces,
    Till our hearts turn, our heads with pulses burning,
        And the walls turn in their places:
    Turns the sky in the high window, blank and reeling,
      Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,
    Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling:
      All are turning, all the day, and we with all.
    And all day the iron wheels are droning,
        And sometimes we could pray,
    'O ye wheels' (breaking out in a mad moaning),
        'Stop! be silent for to-day!'"

    VIII.

    Ay, be silent! Let them hear each other breathing
        For a moment, mouth to mouth!
    Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing
        Of their tender human youth!
    Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
      Is not all the life God fashions or reveals:
    Let them prove their living souls against the notion
      That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
    Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,
        Grinding life down from its mark;
    And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,
        Spin on blindly in the dark.

    IX.

    Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,
        To look up to Him and pray;
    So the blessed One who blesseth all the others,
        Will bless them another day.
    They answer, "Who is God that He should hear us,
      While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
    When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us
      Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word.
    And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
        Strangers speaking at the door:
    Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,
        Hears our weeping any more?

    X.

    "Two words, indeed, of praying we remember,
        And at midnight's hour of harm,
    'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,
        We say softly for a charm.[6]
    We know no other words except 'Our Father,'
      And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,
    God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,
      And hold both within His right hand which is strong.
    'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely
        (For they call Him good and mild)
    Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,
        'Come and rest with me, my child.'

    XI.

    "But, no!" say the children, weeping faster,
        "He is speechless as a stone:
    And they tell us, of His image is the master
        Who commands us to work on.
    Go to!" say the children,--"up in Heaven,
      Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find.
    Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving:
      We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."
    Do you hear the children weeping and disproving,
        O my brothers, what ye preach?
    For God's possible is taught by His world's loving,
        And the children doubt of each.

    XII.

    And well may the children weep before you!
        They are weary ere they run;
    They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
        Which is brighter than the sun.
    They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;
      They sink in man's despair, without its calm;
    Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom,
      Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm:
    Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly
        The harvest of its memories cannot reap,--
    Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly.
        Let them weep! let them weep!

    XIII.

    They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
        And their look is dread to see,
    For they mind you of their angels in high places,
        With eyes turned on Deity.
    "How long," they say, "how long, O cruel nation,
      Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,--
    Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,
      And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
    Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,
        And your purple shows your path!
    But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper
        Than the strong man in his wrath."


A CHILD ASLEEP.


    I.

        How he sleepeth, having drunken
          Weary childhood's mandragore!
        From its pretty eyes have sunken
          Pleasures to make room for more;
    Sleeping near the withered nosegay which he pulled the day before.

    II.

        Nosegays! leave them for the waking;
          Throw them earthward where they grew;
        Dim are such beside the breaking
          Amaranths he looks unto:
    Folded eyes see brighter colours than the open ever do.

    III.

        Heaven-flowers, rayed by shadows golden
          From the palms they sprang beneath,
        Now perhaps divinely holden,
          Swing against him in a wreath:
    We may think so from the quickening of his bloom and of his breath.

    IV.

        Vision unto vision calleth
          While the young child dreameth on:
        Fair, O dreamer, thee befalleth
          With the glory thou hast won!
    Darker wast thou in the garden yestermorn by summer sun.

    V.

        We should see the spirits ringing
          Round thee, were the clouds away:
        'T is the child-heart draws them, singing
          In the silent-seeming clay--
    Singing! stars that seem the mutest go in music all the way.

    VI.

        As the moths around a taper,
          As the bees around a rose,
        As the gnats around a vapour,
          So the spirits group and close
    Round about a holy childhood as if drinking its repose.

    VII.

        Shapes of brightness overlean thee,
          Flash their diadems of youth
        On the ringlets which half screen thee,
          While thou smilest ... not in sooth
    Thy smile, but the overfair one, dropt from some etherial mouth.

    VIII.

        Haply it is angels' duty,
          During slumber, shade by shade
        To fine down this childish beauty
          To the thing it must be made
    Ere the world shall bring it praises, or the tomb shall see it fade.

    IX.

        Softly, softly! make no noises!
          Now he lieth dead and dumb;
        Now he hears the angels' voices
          Folding silence in the room
    Now he muses deep the meaning of the Heaven-words as they come.

    X.

        Speak not! he is consecrated;
          Breathe no breath across his eyes:
        Lifted up and separated
          On the hand of God he lies
    In a sweetness beyond touching, held in cloistral sanctities.

    XI.

        Could ye bless him, father--mother,
          Bless the dimple in his cheek?
        Dare ye look at one another
          And the benediction speak?
    Would ye not break out in weeping and confess yourselves too weak?

    XII.

        He is harmless, ye are sinful;
          Ye are troubled, he at ease;
        From his slumber virtue winful
          Floweth outward with increase.
    Dare not bless him! but be blessèd by his peace, and go in peace.




THE FOURFOLD ASPECT.


    I.

      When ye stood up in the house
        With your little childish feet,
      And, in touching Life's first shows,
        First the touch of Love did meet,--
      Love and Nearness seeming one,
        By the heartlight cast before,
      And of all Beloveds, none
        Standing farther than the door;
      Not a name being dear to thought,
        With its owner beyond call;
      Not a face, unless it brought
        Its own shadow to the wall;
      When the worst recorded change
        Was of apple dropt from bough,
      When love's sorrow seemed more strange
        Than love's treason can seem now;--
      Then, the Loving took you up
        Soft, upon their elder knees,
      Telling why the statues droop
        Underneath the churchyard trees,
      And how ye must lie beneath them
        Through the winters long and deep,
      Till the last trump overbreathe them,
        And ye smile out of your sleep.
    Oh, ye lifted up your head, and it seemed as if they said
        A tale of fairy ships
          With a swan-wing for a sail;
        Oh, ye kissed their loving lips
          For the merry merry tale--
      So carelessly ye thought upon the Dead!

    II.

      Soon ye read in solemn stories
        Of the men of long ago,
      Of the pale bewildering glories
        Shining farther than we know;
      Of the heroes with the laurel,
        Of the poets with the bay,
      Of the two worlds' earnest quarrel
        For that beauteous Helena;
      How Achilles at the portal
        Of the tent heard footsteps nigh,
      And his strong heart, half-immortal,
        Met the keitai with a cry;
      How Ulysses left the sunlight
        For the pale eidola race
      Blank and passive through the dun light,
        Staring blindly in his face;
      How that true wife said to Poetus,
        With calm smile and wounded heart,
      "Sweet, it hurts not!" How Admetus
        Saw his blessed one depart;
      How King Arthur proved his mission,
        And Sir Roland wound his horn,
      And at Sangreal's moony vision
        Swords did bristle round like corn.
    Oh, ye lifted up your head, and it seemed, the while ye read,
        That this Death, then, must be found
        A Valhalla for the crowned,
          The heroic who prevail:
        None, be sure can enter in
        Far below a paladin
          Of a noble noble tale--
      So awfully ye thought upon the Dead!

    III.

      Ay, but soon ye woke up shrieking,
        As a child that wakes at night
      From a dream of sisters speaking
        In a garden's summer-light,--
      That wakes, starting up and bounding,
        In a lonely lonely bed,
      With a wall of darkness round him,
        Stifling black about his head!
      And the full sense of your mortal
        Rushed upon you deep and loud,
      And ye heard the thunder hurtle
        From the silence of the cloud.
      Funeral-torches at your gateway
        Threw a dreadful light within.
      All things changed: you rose up straightway,
        And saluted Death and Sin.
      Since, your outward man has rallied,
        And your eye and voice grown bold;
      Yet the Sphinx of Life stands pallid,
        With her saddest secret told.
      Happy places have grown holy:
        If ye went where once ye went,
      Only tears would fall down slowly,
        As at solemn sacrament.
      Merry books, once read for pastime,
        If ye dared to read again,
      Only memories of the last time
        Would swim darkly up the brain.
      Household names, which used to flutter
        Through your laughter unawares,--
      God's Divinest ye could utter
        With less trembling in your prayers.
    Ye have dropt adown your head, and it seems as if ye tread
        On your own hearts in the path
        Ye are called to in His wrath,
          And your prayers go up in wail
        --"Dost Thou see, then, all our loss,
        O Thou agonized on cross?
          Art thou reading all its tale?"
      So mournfully ye think upon the Dead!

    IV.

      Pray, pray, thou who also weepest,
        And the drops will slacken so.
      Weep, weep, and the watch thou keepest
        With a quicker count will go.
      Think: the shadow on the dial
        For the nature most undone,
      Marks the passing of the trial,
        Proves the presence of the sun.
      Look, look up, in starry passion,
        To the throne above the spheres:
      Learn: the spirit's gravitation
        Still must differ from the tear's.
      Hope: with all the strength thou usest
        In embracing thy despair.
      Love: the earthly love thou losest
        Shall return to thee more fair.
      Work: make clear the forest-tangles
        Of the wildest stranger-land
      Trust: the blessèd deathly angels
        Whisper, "Sabbath hours at hand!"
      By the heart's wound when most gory,
        By the longest agony,
      Smile! Behold in sudden glory
        The TRANSFIGURED smiles on thee!
    And ye lifted up your head, and it seemed as if He said,
        "My Belovèd, is it so?
        Have ye tasted of my woe?
          Of my Heaven ye shall not fail!"
        He stands brightly where the shade is,
        With the keys of Death and Hades,
          And there, ends the mournful tale--
      So hopefully ye think upon the Dead!




NIGHT AND THE MERRY MAN.


NIGHT.

    'Neath my moon what doest thou,
    With a somewhat paler brow
    Than she giveth to the ocean?
    He, without a pulse or motion,
    Muttering low before her stands,
    Lifting his invoking hands
    Like a seer before a sprite,
    To catch her oracles of light:
    But thy soul out-trembles now
    Many pulses on thy brow.
    Where be all thy laughters clear,
    Others laughed alone to hear?
    Where thy quaint jests, said for fame?
    Where thy dances, mixed with game?
    Where thy festive companies,
    Moonèd o'er with ladies' eyes
    All more bright for thee, I trow?
    'Neath my moon what doest thou?


THE MERRY MAN.

    I am digging my warm heart
    Till I find its coldest part;
    I am digging wide and low,
    Further than a spade will go,
    Till that, when the pit is deep
    And large enough, I there may heap
    All my present pain and past
    Joy, dead things that look aghast
    By the daylight: now 't is done.
    Throw them in, by one and one!
    I must laugh, at rising sun.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Memories--of fancy's golden
    Treasures which my hands have holden,
    Till the chillness made them ache;
    Of childhood's hopes that used to wake
    If birds were in a singing strain,
    And for less cause, sleep again;
    Of the moss-seat in the wood
    Where I trysted solitude;
    Of the hill-top where the wind
    Used to follow me behind,
    Then in sudden rush to blind
    Both my glad eyes with my hair,
    Taken gladly in the snare;
    Of the climbing up the rocks,
    Of the playing 'neath the oaks
    Which retain beneath them now
    Only shadow of the bough;
    Of the lying on the grass
    While the clouds did overpass,
    Only they, so lightly driven,
    Seeming betwixt me and Heaven;
    Of the little prayers serene,
    Murmuring of earth and sin;
    Of large-leaved philosophy
    Leaning from my childish knee;
    Of poetic book sublime,
    Soul-kissed for the first dear time,
    Greek or English, ere I knew
    Life was not a poem too:--
    Throw them in, by one and one!
    I must laugh, at rising sun.

       *       *       *       *       *

    --Of the glorious ambitions
    Yet unquenched by their fruitions
    Of the reading out the nights;
    Of the straining at mad heights;
    Of achievements, less descried
    By a dear few than magnified;
    Of praises from the many earned
    When praise from love was undiscerned;
    Of the sweet reflecting gladness
    Softened by itself to sadness:--
    Throw them in, by one and one!
    I must laugh, at rising sun.

       *       *       *       *       *

    What are these? more, more than these!
    Throw in dearer memories!--
    Of voices whereof but to speak
    Makes mine own all sunk and weak;
    Of smiles the thought of which is sweeping
    All my soul to floods of weeping;
    Of looks whose absence fain would weigh
    My looks to the ground for aye;
    Of clasping hands--ah me, I wring
    Mine, and in a tremble fling
    Downward, downward all this paining!
    Partings with the sting remaining,
    Meetings with a deeper throe
    Since the joy is ruined so,
    Changes with a fiery burning,
    (Shadows upon all the turning,)
    Thoughts of ... with a storm they came,
    Them I have not breath to name:
    Downward, downward be they cast
    In the pit! and now at last
    My work beneath the moon is done,
    And I shall laugh, at rising sun.

       *       *       *       *       *

    But let me pause or ere I cover
    All my treasures darkly over:
    I will speak not in thine ears,
    Only tell my beaded tears
    Silently, most silently.
    When the last is calmly told,
    Let that same moist rosary
    With the rest sepùlchred be,
    Finished now! The darksome mould
    Sealeth up the darksome pit.
    I will lay no stone on it,
    Grasses I will sow instead,
    Fit for Queen Titania's tread;
    Flowers, encoloured with the sun,
    And ~ai ai~ written upon none;
    Thus, whenever saileth by
    The Lady World of dainty eye,
    Not a grief shall here remain,
    Silken shoon to damp or stain:
    And while she lisps, "I have not seen
    Any place more smooth and clean" ...
    Here she cometh!--Ha, ha!--who
    Laughs as loud as I can do?




EARTH AND HER PRAISERS.


    I.

            The Earth is old;
    Six thousand winters make her heart a-cold;
    The sceptre slanteth from her palsied hold.
    She saith, "'Las me! God's word that I was 'good'
          Is taken back to heaven,
    From whence when any sound comes, I am riven
    By some sharp bolt; and now no angel would
    Descend with sweet dew-silence on my mountains,
    To glorify the lovely river fountains
          That gush along their side:
    I see--O weary change!--I see instead
          This human wrath and pride,
    These thrones and tombs, judicial wrong and blood,
    And bitter words are poured upon mine head--
    'O Earth! thou art a stage for tricks unholy,
    A church for most remorseful melancholy;
    Thou art so spoilt, we should forget we had
    An Eden in thee, wert thou not so sad!'
    Sweet children, I am old! ye, every one,
    Do keep me from a portion of my sun.
        Give praise in change for brightness!
    That I may shake my hills in infiniteness
    Of breezy laughter, as in youthful mirth,
    To hear Earth's sons and daughters praising Earth."

    II.

      Whereupon a child began
      With spirit running up to man
      As by angels' shining ladder,
      (May he find no cloud above!)
      Seeming he had ne'er been sadder
        All his days than now,
      Sitting in the chestnut grove,
      With that joyous overflow
      Of smiling from his mouth o'er brow
      And cheek and chin, as if the breeze
      Leaning tricksy from the trees
      To part his golden hairs, had blown
      Into an hundred smiles that one.

    III.

    "O rare, rare Earth!" he saith,
      "I will praise thee presently;
    Not to-day; I have no breath:
      I have hunted squirrels three--
    Two ran down in the furzy hollow
    Where I could not see nor follow,
    One sits at the top of the filbert-tree,
    With a yellow nut and a mock at me:
      Presently it shall be done!
    When I see which way these two have run,
    When the mocking one at the filbert-top
    Shall leap a-down and beside me stop,
      Then, rare Earth, rare Earth,
    Will I pause, having known thy worth,
      To say all good of thee!"

    IV.

    Next a lover,--with a dream
    'Neath his waking eyelids hidden,
    And a frequent sigh unbidden,
    And an idlesse all the day
    Beside a wandering stream,
    And a silence that is made
    Of a word he dares not say,--
    Shakes slow his pensive head:
      "Earth, Earth!" saith he,
    "If spirits, like thy roses, grew
    On one stalk, and winds austere
    Could but only blow them near,
      To share each other's dew;--
    If, when summer rains agree
    To beautify thy hills, I knew
    Looking off them I might see
      Some one very beauteous too,--
        Then Earth," saith he,
    "I would praise ... nay, nay--not thee!"

    V.

    Will the pedant name her next?
    Crabbèd with a crabbèd text
    Sits he in his study nook,
    With his elbow on a book,
    And with stately crossèd knees,
    And a wrinkle deeply thrid
    Through his lowering brow,
    Caused by making proofs enow
    That Plato in "Parmenides"
    Meant the same Spinoza did,--
    Or, that an hundred of the groping
    Like himself, had made one Homer,
    Homeros being a misnomer
    What hath he to do with praise
    Of Earth or aught? Whene'er the sloping
    Sunbeams through his window daze
    His eyes off from the learned phrase,
    Straightway he draws close the curtain.
    May abstraction keep him dumb!
    Were his lips to ope, 't is certain
    "Derivatum est" would come.

    VI.

    Then a mourner moveth pale
    In a silence full of wail,
    Raising not his sunken head
    Because he wandered last that way
    With that one beneath the clay:
    Weeping not, because that one,
    The only one who would have said
    "Cease to weep, beloved!" has gone
    Whence returneth comfort none.
    The silence breaketh suddenly,--
    "Earth, I praise thee!" crieth he,
    "Thou hast a grave for also me."

    VII.

    Ha, a poet! know him by
    The ecstasy-dilated eye,
    Not uncharged with tears that ran
    Upward from his heart of man;
    By the cheek, from hour to hour,
    Kindled bright or sunken wan
    With a sense of lonely power;
    By the brow uplifted higher
    Than others, for more low declining
    By the lip which words of fire
    Overboiling have burned white
    While they gave the nations light:
    Ay, in every time and place
    Ye may know the poet's face
      By the shade or shining.

    VIII.

    'Neath a golden cloud he stands,
    Spreading his impassioned hands.
    "O God's Earth!" he saith, "the sign
    From the Father-soul to mine
    Of all beauteous mysteries,
    Of all perfect images
    Which, divine in His divine,
    In my human only are
    Very excellent and fair!
    Think not, Earth, that I would raise
    Weary forehead in thy praise,
    (Weary, that I cannot go
    Farther from thy region low,)
    If were struck no richer meanings
    From thee than thyself. The leaning
    Of the close trees o'er the brim
    Of a sunshine-haunted stream
    Have a sound beneath their leaves,
      Not of wind, not of wind,
    Which the poet's voice achieves:
    The faint mountains, heaped behind,
    Have a falling on their tops,
      Not of dew, not of dew,
    Which the poet's fancy drops:
    Viewless things his eyes can view
    Driftings of his dream do light
    All the skies by day and night,
    And the seas that deepest roll
    Carry murmurs of his soul.
    'Earth, I praise thee! praise thou me!
    God perfecteth his creation
    With this recipient poet-passion,
    And makes the beautiful to be.
    I praise thee, O belovèd sign,
    From the God-soul unto mine!
    Praise me, that I cast on thee
    The cunning sweet interpretation,
    The help and glory and dilation
      Of mine immortality!"

    IX.

    There was silence. None did dare
    To use again the spoken air
    Of that far-charming voice, until
    A Christian resting on the hill,
    With a thoughtful smile subdued
    (Seeming learnt in solitude)
    Which a weeper might have viewed
    Without new tears, did softly say,
    And looked up unto heaven alway
    While he praised the Earth--
                                 "O Earth,
    I count the praises thou art worth,
    By thy waves that move aloud,
    By thy hills against the cloud,
    By thy valleys warm and green,
    By the copses' elms between,
    By their birds which, like a sprite
    Scattered by a strong delight
    Into fragments musical,
    Stir and sing in every bush;
    By thy silver founts that fall,
    As if to entice the stars at night
    To thine heart; by grass and rush,
    And little weeds the children pull,
    Mistook for flowers!
                        --Oh, beautiful
    Art thou, Earth, albeit worse
    Than in heaven is callèd good!
    Good to us, that we may know
    Meekly from thy good to go;
    While the holy, crying Blood
    Puts its music kind and low
    'Twixt such ears as are not dull,
      And thine ancient curse!

    X.

    "Praisèd be the mosses soft
    In thy forest pathways oft,
    And the thorns, which make us think
    Of the thornless river-brink
      Where the ransomed tread:
    Praisèd be thy sunny gleams,
    And the storm, that worketh dreams
      Of calm unfinishèd:
    Praisèd be thine active days,
    And thy night-time's solemn need,
    When in God's dear book we read
      No night shall be therein:
    Praisèd be thy dwellings warm
    By household faggot's cheerful blaze,
    Where, to hear of pardoned sin,
    Pauseth oft the merry din,
    Save the babe's upon the arm
    Who croweth to the crackling wood:
    Yea, and, better understood,
    Praisèd be thy dwellings cold,
    Hid beneath the churchyard mould,
    Where the bodies of the saints
    Separate from earthly taints
    Lie asleep, in blessing bound,
    Waiting for the trumpet's sound
    To free them into blessing;--none
    Weeping more beneath the sun,
    Though dangerous words of human love
    Be graven very near, above.

    XI.

    "Earth, we Christians praise thee thus,
    Even for the change that comes
    With a grief from thee to us:
    For thy cradles and thy tombs,
    For the pleasant corn and wine
    And summer-heat; and also for
    The frost upon the sycamore
      And hail upon the vine!"




THE VIRGIN MARY TO THE CHILD JESUS.

    But see the Virgin blest
    Hath laid her babe to rest.

    MILTON'S Hymn on the Nativity.


    I.

          Sleep, sleep, mine Holy One!
    My flesh, my Lord!--what name? I do not know
    A name that seemeth not too high or low,
          Too far from me or heaven:
    My Jesus, that is best! that word being given
    By the majestic angel whose command
    Was softly as a man's beseeching said,
    When I and all the earth appeared to stand
          In the great overflow
    Of light celestial from his wings and head.
          Sleep, sleep, my saving One!

    II.

    And art Thou come for saving, baby-browed
    And speechless Being--art Thou come for saving?
    The palm that grows beside our door is bowed
    By treadings of the low wind from the south,
    A restless shadow through the chamber waving:
    Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun,
    But Thou, with that close slumber on Thy mouth,
    Dost seem of wind and sun already weary.
    Art come for saving, O my weary One?

    III.

    Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary
    Earth-sounds and motions, opens on Thy soul
        High dreams on fire with God;
    High songs that make the pathways where they roll
    More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new
    Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode.
        Suffer this mother's kiss,
        Best thing that earthly is,
    To glide the music and the glory through,
    Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings
        Of any seraph wing.
    Thus noiseless, thus. Sleep, sleep my dreaming One!

    IV.

    The slumber of His lips meseems to run
    Through my lips to mine heart, to all its shiftings
    Of sensual life, bringing contrariousness
    In a great calm. I feel I could lie down
    As Moses did, and die,[7]--and then live most.
    I am 'ware of you, heavenly Presences,
    That stand with your peculiar light unlost,
    Each forehead with a high thought for a crown,
    Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw
    No shade against the wall! How motionless
    Ye round me with your living statuary,
    While through your whiteness, in and outwardly,
    Continual thoughts of God appear to go,
    Like light's soul in itself. I bear, I bear
    To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes,
    Though their external shining testifies
    To that beatitude within which were
    Enough to blast an eagle at his sun:
    I fall not on my sad clay face before ye,--
          I look on His. I know
    My spirit which dilateth with the woe
            Of His mortality,
            May well contain your glory.
          Yea, drop your lids more low.
    Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me!
          Sleep, sleep, my worshipped One!

    V.

    We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem;
    The dumb kine from their fodder turning them,
        Softened their hornèd faces
        To almost human gazes
        Toward the newly Born:
    The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks
        Brought visionary looks,
    As yet in their astonied hearing rung
        The strange sweet angel-tongue:
    The magi of the East, in sandals worn,
        Knelt reverent, sweeping round,
      With long pale beards, their gifts upon the ground,
        The incense, myrrh and gold
    These baby hands were impotent to hold:
    So let all earthlies and celestials wait
        Upon Thy royal state.
        Sleep, sleep, my kingly One!

    VI.

    I am not proud--meek angels, ye invest
    New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest
    On mortal lips,--"I am not proud"--not proud!
    Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son,
    Albeit over Him my head is bowed
    As others bow before Him, still mine heart
    Bows lower than their knees. O centuries
    That roll in vision your futurities
          My future grave athwart,--
    Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep
          Watch o'er this sleep,--
    Say of me as the Heavenly said--"Thou art
    The blessedest of women!"--blessedest,
    Not holiest, not noblest, no high name
    Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame
    When I sit meek in heaven!
                                For me, for me,
    God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
    I often wandered forth, more child than maiden
    Among the midnight hills of Galilee
          Whose summits looked heaven-laden,
    Listening to silence as it seemed to be
    God's voice, so soft yet strong, so fain to press
    Upon my heart as heaven did on the height,
    And waken up its shadows by a light,
    And show its vileness by a holiness.
    Then I knelt down most silent like the night,
          Too self-renounced for fears,
    Raising my small face to the boundless blue
    Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
    God heard them falling after, with His dew.

    VII.

    So, seeing my corruption, can I see
    This Incorruptible now born of me,
    This fair new Innocence no sun did chance
    To shine on, (for even Adam was no child,)
    Created from my nature all defiled,
    This mystery, from out mine ignorance,--
    Nor feel the blindness, stain, corruption, more
    Than others do, or I did heretofore?
    Can hands wherein such burden pure has been,
    Not open with the cry "unclean, unclean,"
    More oft than any else beneath the skies?
          Ah King, ah, Christ, ah son!
    The kine, the shepherds, the abasèd wise
          Must all less lowly wait
          Than I, upon Thy state.
        Sleep, sleep, my kingly One!

    VIII.

    Art Thou a King, then? Come, His universe,
    Come, crown me Him a King!
    Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
      Their light where fell a curse,
    And make a crowning for this kingly brow!--
    What is my word? Each empyreal star
          Sits in a sphere afar
          In shining ambuscade:
          The child-brow, crowned by none,
          Keeps its unchildlike shade.
          Sleep, sleep, my crownless One!

    IX.

    Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear
    An aspect very sorrowful, as Thou.
    No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen
    To float like speech the speechless lips between,
    No dovelike cooing in the golden air,
    No quick short joys of leaping babyhood.
          Alas, our earthly good
    In heaven thought evil, seems too good for Thee;
          Yet, sleep, my weary One!

    X.

    And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy,
    With the dread sense of things which shall be done,
    Doth smite me inly, like a sword: a sword?
    That "smites the Shepherd." Then, I think aloud
    The words "despised,"--"rejected,"--every word
    Recoiling into darkness as I view
          The DARLING on my knee.
    Bright angels,--move not--lest ye stir the cloud
    Betwixt my soul and His futurity!
    I must not die, with mother's work to do,
          And could not live-and see.

    XI.

          It is enough to bear
          This image still and fair,
          This holier in sleep
          Than a saint at prayer,
          This aspect of a child
          Who never sinned or smiled;
          This Presence in an infant's face;
          This sadness most like love,
          This love than love more deep,
          This weakness like omnipotence
          It is so strong to move.
          Awful is this watching place,
          Awful what I see from hence--
          A king, without regalia,
          A God, without the thunder,
          A child, without the heart for play;
          Ay, a Creator, rent asunder
          From His first glory and cast away
          On His own world, for me alone
      To hold in hands created, crying--SON!

    XII.

          That tear fell not on Thee,
    Beloved, yet thou stirrest in thy slumber!
    THOU, stirring not for glad sounds out of number
    Which through the vibratory palm-trees run
          From summer-wind and bird,
          So quickly hast thou heard
          A tear fall silently?
          Wak'st thou, O loving One?--


AN ISLAND.

    All goeth but Goddis will.--OLD POET.


    I.

    My dream is of an island-place
      Which distant seas keep lonely,
    A little island on whose face
      The stars are watchers only:
    Those bright still stars! they need not seem
    Brighter or stiller in my dream.

    II.

    An island full of hills and dells,
      All rumpled and uneven
    With green recesses, sudden swells,
      And odorous valleys driven
    So deep and straight that always there
    The wind is cradled to soft air.

    III.

    Hills running up to heaven for light
      Through woods that half-way ran,
    As if the wild earth mimicked right
      The wilder heart of man:
    Only it shall be greener far
    And gladder than hearts ever are.

    IV.

    More like, perhaps, that mountain piece
      Of Dante's paradise,
    Disrupt to an hundred hills like these,
      In falling from the skies;
    Bringing within it, all the roots
    Of heavenly trees and flowers and fruits:

    V.

    For--saving where the grey rocks strike
      Their javelins up the azure,
    Or where deep fissures miser-like
      Hoard up some fountain treasure,
    (And e'en in them, stoop down and hear,
    Leaf sounds with water in your ear,--)

    VI.

    The place is all awave with trees,
      Limes, myrtles purple-beaded,
    Acacias having drunk the lees
      Of the night-dew, faint-headed,
    And wan grey olive-woods which seem
    The fittest foliage for a dream.

    VII.

    Trees, trees on all sides! they combine
      Their plumy shades to throw,
    Through whose clear fruit and blossom fine
      Whene'er the sun may go,
    The ground beneath he deeply stains,
    As passing through cathedral panes.

    VIII.

    But little needs this earth of ours
      That shining from above her,
    When many Pleiades of flowers
      (Not one lost) star her over,
    The rays of their unnumbered hues
    Being all refracted by the dews.

    IX.

    Wide-petalled plants that boldly drink
      The Amreeta of the sky,
    Shut bells that dull with rapture sink,
      And lolling buds, half shy;
    I cannot count them, but between
    Is room for grass and mosses green,

    X.

    And brooks, that glass in different strengths
      All colours in disorder,
    Or, gathering up their silver lengths
      Beside their winding border,
    Sleep, haunted through the slumber hidden,
    By lilies white as dreams in Eden.

    XI.

    Nor think each archèd tree with each
      Too closely interlaces
    To admit of vistas out of reach,
      And broad moon-lighted places
    Upon whose sward the antlered deer
    May view their double image clear.

    XII.

    For all this island's creature-full,
      (Kept happy not by halves)
    Mild cows, that at the vine-wreaths pull,
      Then low back at their calves
    With tender lowings, to approve
    The warm mouths milking them for love.

    XIII.

    Free gamesome horses, antelopes,
      And harmless leaping leopards,
    And buffaloes upon the slopes,
      And sheep unruled by shepherds:
    Hares, lizards, hedgehogs, badgers, mice,
    Snakes, squirrels, frogs, and butterflies.

    XIV.

    And birds that live there in a crowd,
      Horned owls, rapt nightingales,
    Larks bold with heaven, and peacocks proud,
      Self-sphered in those grand tails;
    All creatures glad and safe, I deem
    No guns nor springes in my dream!

    XV.

    The island's edges are a-wing
      With trees that overbranch
    The sea with song-birds welcoming
      The curlews to green change;
    And doves from half-closed lids espy
    The red and purple fish go by.

    XVI.

    One dove is answering in trust
      The water every minute,
    Thinking so soft a murmur must
      Have her mate's cooing in it:
    So softly doth earth's beauty round
    Infuse itself in ocean's sound.

    XVII.

    My sanguine soul bounds forwarder
      To meet the bounding waves;
    Beside them straightway I repair,
      To live within the caves:
    And near me two or three may dwell
    Whom dreams fantastic please as well.

    XVIII.

    Long winding caverns, glittering far
      Into a crystal distance!
    Through clefts of which shall many a star
      Shine clear without resistance,
    And carry down its rays the smell
    Of flowers above invisible.

    XIX.

    I said that two or three might choose
      Their dwelling near mine own:
    Those who would change man's voice and use,
      For Nature's way and tone--
    Man's veering heart and careless eyes,
    For Nature's steadfast sympathies.

    XX.

    Ourselves, to meet her faithfulness,
      Shall play a faithful part;
    Her beautiful shall ne'er address
      The monstrous at our heart:
    Her musical shall ever touch
    Something within us also such.

    XXI.

    Yet shall she not our mistress live,
      As doth the moon of ocean,
    Though gently as the moon she give
      Our thoughts a light and motion:
    More like a harp of many lays,
    Moving its master while he plays.

    XXII.

    No sod in all that island doth
      Yawn open for the dead;
    No wind hath borne a traitor's oath;
      No earth, a mourner's tread;
    We cannot say by stream or shade,
    "I suffered here,--was here betrayed."

    XXIII.

    Our only "farewell" we shall laugh
      To shifting cloud or hour,
    And use our only epitaph
      To some bud turned a flower:
    Our only tears shall serve to prove
    Excess in pleasure or in love.

    XXIV.

    Our fancies shall their plumage catch
      From fairest island-birds,
    Whose eggs let young ones out at hatch,
      Born singing! then our words
    Unconsciously shall take the dyes
    Of those prodigious fantasies.

    XXV.

    Yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth
      Our smile-tuned lips shall reach;
    Sounds sweet as Hellas spake in youth
      Shall glide into our speech:
    (What music, certes, can you find
    As soft as voices which are kind?)

    XXVI.

    And often, by the joy without
      And in us, overcome,
    We, through our musing, shall let float
      Such poems,--sitting dumb,--
    As Pindar might have writ if he
      Had tended sheep in Arcady;

    XXVII.

    Or Æschylus--the pleasant fields
      He died in, longer knowing;
    Or Homer, had men's sins and shields
      Been lost in Meles flowing;
    Or Poet Plato, had the undim
    Unsetting Godlight broke on him.

    XXVIII.

    Choose me the cave most worthy choice,
      To make a place for prayer,
    And I will choose a praying voice
      To pour our spirits there:
    How silverly the echoes run!
    Thy will be done,--thy will be done.

    XXIX.

    Gently yet strangely uttered words!
      They lift me from my dream;
    The island fadeth with its swards
      That did no more than seem:
    The streams are dry, no sun could find--
    The fruits are fallen, without wind.

    XXX.

    So oft the doing of God's will
      Our foolish wills undoeth!
    And yet what idle dream breaks ill,
      Which morning-light subdueth?
    And who would murmur and misdoubt,
    When God's great sunrise finds him out?




THE SOUL'S TRAVELLING.

    ~Êdê noerous
    Petasai tarsous.~

    SYNESIUS.


    I.

    I dwell amid the city ever.
    The great humanity which beats
    Its life along the stony streets,
    Like a strong and unsunned river
    In a self-made course,
    I sit and hearken while it rolls.
    Very sad and very hoarse
    Certes is the flow of souls;
    Infinitest tendencies
    By the finite prest and pent,
    In the finite, turbulent:
    How we tremble in surprise
    When sometimes, with an awful sound,
    God's great plummet strikes the ground!

    II.

    The champ of the steeds on the silver bit,
    As they whirl the rich man's carriage by;
    The beggar's whine as he looks at it,--
    But it goes too fast for charity;
    The trail on the street of the poor man's broom,
    That the lady who walks to her palace-home,
    On her silken skirt may catch no dust;
    The tread of the business-men who must
    Count their per-cents by the paces they take;
    The cry of the babe unheard of its mother
    Though it lie on her breast, while she thinks of the other
    Laid yesterday where it will not wake;
    The flower-girl's prayer to buy roses and pinks
    Held out in the smoke, like stars by day;
    The gin-door's oath that hollowly chinks
    Guilt upon grief and wrong upon hate;
    The cabman's cry to get out of the way;
    The dustman's call down the area-grate;
    The young maid's jest, and the old wife's scold,
    The haggling talk of the boys at a stall,
    The fight in the street which is backed for gold,
    The plea of the lawyers in Westminster Hall;
    The drop on the stones of the blind man's staff
    As he trades in his own grief's sacredness,
    The brothel shriek, and the Newgate laugh,
    The hum upon 'Change, and the organ's grinding,
    (The grinder's face being nevertheless
    Dry and vacant of even woe
    While the children's hearts are leaping so
    At the merry music's winding;)
    The black-plumed funeral's creeping train,
    Long and slow (and yet they will go
    As fast as Life though it hurry and strain!)
    Creeping the populous houses through
    And nodding their plumes at either side,--
    At many a house, where an infant, new
    To the sunshiny world, has just struggled and cried,--
    At many a house where sitteth a bride
    Trying to-morrow's coronals
    With a scarlet blush to-day:
      Slowly creep the funerals,
    As none should hear the noise and say
    "The living, the living must go away
        To multiply the dead."
      Hark! an upward shout is sent,
    In grave strong joy from tower to steeple
        The bells ring out,
    The trumpets sound, the people shout,
    The young queen goes to her Parliament.
    She turneth round her large blue eyes
    More bright with childish memories
    Than royal hopes, upon the people;
    On either side she bows her head
      Lowly, with a queenly grace
    And smile most trusting-innocent,
    As if she smiled upon her mother;
    The thousands press before each other
        To bless her to her face;
    And booms the deep majestic voice
    Through trump and drum,--"May the queen rejoice
        In the people's liberties!"

    III.

        I dwell amid the city,
        And hear the flow of souls in act and speech,
    For pomp or trade, for merrymake or folly:
    I hear the confluence and sum of each,
        And that is melancholy!
    Thy voice is a complaint, O crownèd city,
    The blue sky covering thee like God's great pity.

    IV.

    O blue sky! it mindeth me
    Of places where I used to see
    Its vast unbroken circle thrown
    From the far pale-peakèd hill
    Out to the last verge of ocean,
    As by God's arm it were done
    Then for the first time, with the emotion
    Of that first impulse on it still.
    Oh, we spirits fly at will
    Faster than the wingèd steed
    Whereof in old book we read,
    With the sunlight foaming back
    From his flanks to a misty wrack,
    And his nostril reddening proud
    As he breasteth the steep thundercloud,--
    Smoother than Sabrina's chair
    Gliding up from wave to air,
    While she smileth debonair
    Yet holy, coldly and yet brightly,
    Like her own mooned waters nightly,
      Through her dripping hair.

    V.

    Very fast and smooth we fly,
    Spirits, though the flesh be by;
    All looks feed not from the eye
    Nor all hearings from the ear:
    We can hearken and espy
    Without either, we can journey
    Bold and gay as knight to tourney,
    And, though we wear no visor down
    To dark our countenance, the foe
    Shall never chafe us as we go.

    VI.

    I am gone from peopled town!
    It passeth its street-thunder round
    My body which yet hears no sound,
    For now another sound, another
    Vision, my soul's senses have--
    O'er a hundred valleys deep
    Where the hills' green shadows sleep
    Scarce known because the valley-trees
    Cross those upland images,
    O'er a hundred hills each other
    Watching to the western wave,
    I have travelled,--I have found
    The silent, lone, remembered ground.

    VII.

    I have found a grassy niche
    Hollowed in a seaside hill,
    As if the ocean-grandeur which
    Is aspectable from the place,
    Had struck the hill as with a mace
    Sudden and cleaving. You might fill
    That little nook with the little cloud
    Which sometimes lieth by the moon
    To beautify a night of June;
    A cavelike nook which, opening all
    To the wide sea, is disallowed
    From its own earth's sweet pastoral:
    Cavelike, but roofless overhead
    And made of verdant banks instead
    Of any rocks, with flowerets spread
    Instead of spar and stalactite,
    Cowslips and daisies gold and white:
    Such pretty flowers on such green sward,
    You think the sea they look toward
    Doth serve them for another sky
    As warm and blue as that on high.

    VIII.

    And in this hollow is a seat,
    And when you shall have crept to it,
    Slipping down the banks too steep
    To be o'erbrowzèd by the sheep,
    Do not think--though at your feet
    The cliffs disrupt--you shall behold
    The line where earth and ocean meet;
    You sit too much above to view
    The solemn confluence of the two:
    You can hear them as they greet,
    You can hear that evermore
    Distance-softened noise more old
    Than Nereid's singing, the tide spent
    Joining soft issues with the shore
    In harmony of discontent,
    And when you hearken to the grave
    Lamenting of the underwave,
    You must believe in earth's communion
    Albeit you witness not the union.

    IX.

    Except that sound, the place is full
    Of silences, which when you cull
    By any word, it thrills you so
    That presently you let them grow
    To meditation's fullest length
    Across your soul with a soul's strength:
    And as they touch your soul, they borrow
    Both of its grandeur and its sorrow,
    That deathly odour which the clay
    Leaves on its deathlessness alwày.

    X.

    Alway! alway? must this be?
    Rapid Soul from city gone,
    Dost thou carry inwardly
    What doth make the city's moan?
    Must this deep sigh of thine own
    Haunt thee with humanity?
    Green visioned banks that are too steep
    To be o'erbrowzèd by the sheep,
    May all sad thoughts adown you creep
    Without a shepherd? Mighty sea,
    Can we dwarf thy magnitude
    And fit it to our straitest mood?
    O fair, fair Nature, are we thus
    Impotent and querulous
    Among thy workings glorious,
    Wealth and sanctities, that still
    Leave us vacant and defiled
    And wailing like a soft-kissed child,
    Kissed soft against his will?

    XI.

                God, God!
            With a child's voice I cry,
            Weak, sad, confidingly--
                God, God!
    Thou knowest, eyelids, raised not always up
    Unto Thy love, (as none of ours are) droop
        As ours, o'er many a tear;
    Thou knowest, though Thy universe is broad,
    Two little tears suffice to cover all:
    Thou knowest, Thou who art so prodigal
    Of beauty, we are oft but stricken deer
    Expiring in the woods, that care for none
    Of those delightsome flowers they die upon.

    XII.

    O blissful Mouth which breathed the mournful breath
    We name our souls, self-spoilt!--by that strong passion
    Which paled Thee once with sighs, by that strong death
    Which made Thee once unbreathing--from the wrack
    Themselves have called around them, call them back,
    Back to Thee in continuous aspiration!
        For here, O Lord,
    For here they travel vainly, vainly pass
    From city-pavement to untrodden sward
    Where the lark finds her deep nest in the grass
    Cold with the earth's last dew. Yea, very vain
    The greatest speed of all these souls of men
    Unless they travel upward to the throne
    Where sittest THOU the satisfying ONE,
    With help for sins and holy perfectings
    For all requirements: while the archangel, raising
    Unto Thy face his full ecstatic gazing,
    Forgets the rush and rapture of his wings.




TO BETTINE,

THE CHILD-FRIEND OF GOETHE.

"I have the second sight, Goethe!"--Letters of a Child.


    I.

      Bettine, friend of Goethe,
    Hadst thou the second sight--
    Upturning worship and delight
      With such a loving duty
    To his grand face, as women will,
    The childhood 'neath thine eyelids still?

    II.

      --Before his shrine to doom thee,
    Using the same child's smile
    That heaven and earth, beheld erewhile
      For the first time, won from thee
    Ere star and flower grew dim and dead
    Save at his feet and o'er his head?

    III.

      --Digging thine heart and throwing
    Away its childhood's gold,
    That so its woman-depth might hold
      His spirit's overflowing?
    (For surging souls, no worlds can bound,
    Their channel in the heart have found.)

    IV.

      O child, to change appointed,
    Thou hadst not second sight!
    What eyes the future view aright
      Unless by tears anointed?
    Yea, only tears themselves can show
    The burning ones that have to flow.

    V.

      O woman, deeply loving,
    Thou hadst not second sight!
    The star is very high and bright,
      And none can see it moving.
    Love looks around, below, above,
    Yet all his prophecy is--love.

    VI.

      The bird thy childhood's playing
    Sent onward o'er the sea,
    Thy dove of hope came back to thee
      Without a leaf: art laying
    Its wet cold wing no sun can dry,
    Still in thy bosom secretly?

    VII.

      Our Goethe's friend, Bettine,
    I have the second sight!
    The stone upon his grave is white,
      The funeral stone between ye;
    And in thy mirror thou hast viewed
    Some change as hardly understood.

    VIII.

      Where's childhood? where is Goethe?
    The tears are in thine eyes.
    Nay, thou shalt yet reorganize
      Thy maidenhood of beauty
    In his own glory, which is smooth
    Of wrinkles and sublime in youth.

    IX.

      The poet's arms have wound thee,
    He breathes upon thy brow,
    He lifts thee upward in the glow
      Of his great genius round thee,--
    The childlike poet undefiled
    Preserving evermore THE CHILD.




MAN AND NATURE.


    A sad man on a summer day
    Did look upon the earth and say--

    "Purple cloud the hill-top binding;
    Folded hills the valleys wind in;
    Valleys with fresh streams among you;
    Streams with bosky trees along you;
    Trees with many birds and blossoms;
    Birds with music-trembling bosoms;
    Blossoms dropping dews that wreathe you
    To your fellow flowers beneath you;
    Flowers that constellate on earth;
    Earth that shakest to the mirth
    Of the merry Titan Ocean,
    All his shining hair in motion!
    Why am I thus the only one
    Who can be dark beneath the sun?"

    But when the summer day was past,
    He looked to heaven and smiled at last,
    Self-answered so--
                      "Because, O cloud,
    Pressing with thy crumpled shroud
    Heavily on mountain top,--
    Hills that almost seem to drop
    Stricken with a misty death
    To the valleys underneath,--
    Valleys sighing with the torrent,--
    Waters streaked with branches horrent,--
    Branchless trees that shake your head
    Wildly o'er your blossoms spread
    Where the common flowers are found,--
    Flowers with foreheads to the ground,--
    Ground that shriekest while the sea
    With his iron smiteth thee--
    I am, besides, the only one
    Who can be bright without the sun."




A SEA-SIDE WALK.


    I.

          We walked beside the sea
    After a day which perished silently
    Of its own glory--like the princess weird
    Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared,
    Uttered with burning breath, "Ho! victory!"
    And sank adown, a heap of ashes pale:
          So runs the Arab tale.

    II.

          The sky above us showed
    A universal and unmoving cloud
    On which the cliffs permitted us to see
    Only the outline of their majesty,
    As master-minds when gazed at by the crowd:
    And shining with a gloom, the water grey
          Swang in its moon-taught way.

    III.

          Nor moon, nor stars were out;
    They did not dare to tread so soon about,
    Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun:
    The light was neither night's nor day's, but one
    Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt,
    And silence's impassioned breathings round
          Seemed wandering into sound.

    IV.

          O solemn-beating heart
    Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art
    Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever;
    And, what time they are slackened by him ever,
    So to attest his own supernal part,
    Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong
          The slackened cord along:

    V.

          For though we never spoke
    Of the grey water and the shaded rock,
    Dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused
    Into the plaintive speaking that we used
    Of absent friends and memories unforsook;
    And, had we seen each other's face, we had
          Seen haply each was sad.




THE SEA-MEW.

AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO M. E. H.


    I.

    How joyously the young sea-mew
    Lay dreaming on the waters blue
    Whereon our little bark had thrown
    A little shade, the only one,
    But shadows ever man pursue.

    II.

    Familiar with the waves and free
    As if their own white foam were he,
    His heart upon the heart of ocean
    Lay learning all its mystic motion,
    And throbbing to the throbbing sea.

    III.

    And such a brightness in his eye
    As if the ocean and the sky
    Within him had lit up and nurst
    A soul God gave him not at first,
    To comprehend their majesty.

    IV.

    We were not cruel, yet did sunder
    His white wing from the blue waves under,
    And bound it, while his fearless eyes
    Shone up to ours in calm surprise,
    As deeming us some ocean wonder.

    V.

    We bore our ocean bird unto
    A grassy place where he might view
    The flowers that curtsey to the bees,
    The waving of the tall green trees,
    The falling of the silver dew.

    VI.

    But flowers of earth were pale to him
    Who had seen the rainbow fishes swim;
    And when earth's dew around him lay
    He thought of ocean's wingèd spray,
    And his eye waxèd sad and dim.

    VII.

    The green trees round him only made
    A prison with their darksome shade;
    And drooped his wing, and mournèd he
    For his own boundless glittering sea--
    Albeit he knew not they could fade.

    VIII.

    Then One her gladsome face did bring,
    Her gentle voice's murmuring,
    In ocean's stead his heart to move
    And teach him what was human love:
    He thought it a strange, mournful thing.

    IX.

    He lay down in his grief to die,
    (First looking to the sea-like sky
    That hath no waves) because, alas!
    Our human touch did on him pass,
    And, with our touch, our agony.




FELICIA HEMANS

TO L. E. L.,

REFERRING TO HER MONODY ON THE POETESS.


    I.

    Thou bay-crowned living One that o'er the bay-crowned Dead art bowing,
    And o'er the shadeless moveless brow the vital shadow throwing,
    And o'er the sighless songless lips the wail and music wedding,
    And dropping o'er the tranquil eyes the tears not of their shedding!--

    II.

    Take music from the silent Dead whose meaning is completer,
    Reserve thy tears for living brows where all such tears are meeter,
    And leave the violets in the grass to brighten where thou treadest,
    No flowers for her! no need of flowers, albeit "bring flowers!" thou
        saidest.

    III.

    Yes, flowers, to crown the "cup and lute," since both may come to
        breaking,
    Or flowers, to greet the "bride"--the heart's own beating works its
        aching;
    Or flowers, to soothe the "captive's" sight, from earth's free bosom
        gathered,
    Reminding of his earthly hope, then withering as it withered:

    IV.

    But bring not near the solemn corse a type of human seeming,
    Lay only dust's stern verity upon the dust undreaming:
    And while the calm perpetual stars shall look upon it solely,
    Her spherèd soul shall look on them with eyes more bright and holy.

    V.

    Nor mourn, O living One, because her part in life was mourning:
    Would she have lost the poet's fire for anguish of the burning?
    The minstrel harp, for the strained string? the tripod, for the
        afflated
    Woe? or the vision, for those tears in which it shone dilated?

    VI.

    Perhaps she shuddered while the world's cold hand her brow was
        wreathing,
    But never wronged that mystic breath which breathed in all her
        breathing,
    Which drew, from rocky earth and man, abstractions high and moving,
    Beauty, if not the beautiful, and love, if not the loving.

    VII.

    Such visionings have paled in sight; the Saviour she descrieth,
    And little recks who wreathed the brow which on His bosom lieth:
    The whiteness of His innocence o'er all her garments, flowing,
    There learneth she the sweet "new song" she will not mourn in knowing.

    VIII.

    Be happy, crowned and living One! and as thy dust decayeth
    May thine own England say for thee what now for Her it sayeth--
    "Albeit softly in our ears her silver song was ringing,
    The foot-fall of her parting soul is softer than her singing."




L. E. L.'S LAST QUESTION.

    "Do you think of me as I think of you?"
    (From her poem written during the voyage to the Cape.)


    I.

    "Do you think of me as I think of you,
    My friends, my friends?"--She said it from the sea,
    The English minstrel in her minstrelsy,
    While, under brighter skies than erst she knew,
    Her heart grew dark, and groped there as the blind
    To reach across the waves friends left behind--
    "Do you think of me as I think of you?"

    II.

    It seemed not much to ask--"as I of you?"
    We all do ask the same; no eyelids cover
    Within the meekest eyes that question over:
    And little in the world the Loving do
    But sit (among the rocks?) and listen for
    The echo of their own love evermore--
    "Do you think of me as I think of you?"

    III.

    Love-learnèd she had sung of love and love,--
    And like a child that, sleeping with dropt head
    Upon the fairy-book he lately read,
    Whatever household noises round him move,
    Hears in his dream some elfin turbulence,--
    Even so suggestive to her inward sense,
    All sounds of life assumed one tune of love.

    IV.

    And when the glory of her dream withdrew,
    When knightly gestes and courtly pageantries
    Were broken in her visionary eyes
    By tears the solemn seas attested true,--
    Forgetting that sweet lute beside her hand,
    She asked not,--"Do you praise me, O my land?"
    But,--"Think ye of me, friends, as I of you?"

    V.

    Hers was the hand that played for many a year
    Love's silver phrase for England, smooth and well.
    Would God her heart's more inward oracle
    In that lone moment might confirm her dear!
    For when her questioned friends in agony
    Made passionate response, "We think of thee,"
    Her place was in the dust, too deep to hear.

    VI.

    Could she not wait to catch their answering breath?
    Was she content, content with ocean's sound
    Which dashed its mocking infinite around
    One thirsty for a little love?--beneath
    Those stars content, where last her song had gone,--
    They mute and cold in radiant life, as soon
    Their singer was to be, in darksome death?[8]

    VII.

    Bring your vain answers--cry, "We think of thee!"
    How think ye of her? warm in long ago
    Delights? or crowned with budding bays? Not so.
    None smile and none are crowned where lieth she,
    With all her visions unfulfilled save one,
    Her childhood's, of the palm-trees in the sun--
    And lo! their shadow on her sepulchre!

    VIII.

    "Do ye think of me as I think of you?"--
    O friends, O kindred, O dear brotherhood
    Of all the world! what are we that we should
    For covenants of long affection sue?
    Why press so near each other when the touch
    Is barred by graves? Not much, and yet too much
    Is this "Think of me as I think of you."

    IX.

    But while on mortal lips I shape anew
    A sigh to mortal issues, verily
    Above the unshaken stars that see us die,
    A vocal pathos rolls; and HE who drew
    All life from dust, and for all tasted death,
    By death and life and love appealing, saith
    Do you think of me as I think of you?

POEMS


A CHILD'S GRAVE AT FLORENCE.

A.A.E.C.

Born, July 1848. Died, November 1849


  I.

  Of English blood, of Tuscan birth,
    What country should we give her?
  Instead of any on the earth,
    The civic Heavens receive her.

  II.

  And here among the English tombs
    In Tuscan ground we lay her,
  While the blue Tuscan sky endomes
    Our English words of prayer.

  III.

  A little child!--how long she lived,
    By months, not years, is reckoned:
  Born in one July, she survived
    Alone to see a second.

  IV.

  Bright-featured, as the July sun
    Her little face still played in,
  And splendours, with her birth begun,
    Had had no time for fading.

  V.

  So, LILY, from those July hours,
    No wonder we should call her;
  She looked such kinship to the flowers,--
    Was but a little taller.

  VI.

  A Tuscan Lily,--only white,
    As Dante, in abhorrence
  Of red corruption, wished aright
    The lilies of his Florence.

  VII.

  We could not wish her whiter,--her
    Who perfumed with pure blossom
  The house--a lovely thing to wear
    Upon a mother's bosom!

  VIII.

  This July creature thought perhaps
    Our speech not worth assuming;
  She sat upon her parents' laps
    And mimicked the gnat's humming;

  IX.

  Said "father," "mother"--then left off,
    For tongues celestial, fitter:
  Her hair had grown just long enough
    To catch heaven's jasper-glitter.

  X.

  Babes! Love could always hear and see
    Behind the cloud that hid them.
  "Let little children come to Me,
    And do not thou forbid them."

  XI.

  So, unforbidding, have we met,
    And gently here have laid her,
  Though winter is no time to get
    The flowers that should o'erspread her:

  XII.

  We should bring pansies quick with spring,
    Rose, violet, daffodilly,
  And also, above everything,
    White lilies for our Lily.

  XIII.

  Nay, more than flowers, this grave exacts,--
    Glad, grateful attestations
  Of her sweet eyes and pretty acts,
    With calm renunciations.

  XIV.

  Her very mother with light feet
    Should leave the place too earthy,
  Saying "The angels have thee, Sweet,
    Because we are not worthy."

  XV.

  But winter kills the orange-buds,
    The gardens in the frost are,
  And all the heart dissolves in floods,
    Remembering we have lost her.

  XVI.

  Poor earth, poor heart,--too weak, too weak
    To miss the July shining!
  Poor heart!--what bitter words we speak
    When God speaks of resigning!

  XVII.

  Sustain this heart in us that faints,
    Thou God, the self-existent!
  We catch up wild at parting saints
    And feel Thy heaven too distant.

  XVIII.

  The wind that swept them out of sin
    Has ruffled all our vesture:
  On the shut door that let them in
    We beat with frantic gesture,--

  XIX.

  To us, us also, open straight!
    The outer life is chilly;
  Are we too, like the earth, to wait
    Till next year for our Lily?

  XX.

  --Oh, my own baby on my knees,
    My leaping, dimpled treasure,
  At every word I write like these,
    Clasped close with stronger pressure!

  XXI.

  Too well my own heart understands,--
    At every word beats fuller--
  My little feet, my little hands,
    And hair of Lily's colour!

  XXII.

  But God gives patience, Love learns strength,
    And Faith remembers promise,
  And Hope itself can smile at length
    On other hopes gone from us.

  XXIII.

  Love, strong as Death, shall conquer Death,
    Through struggle made more glorious:
  This mother stills her sobbing breath,
    Renouncing yet victorious.

  XXIV.

  Arms, empty of her child, she lifts
    With spirit unbereaven,--
  "God will not all take back His gifts;
    My Lily's mine in heaven.

  XXV.

  "Still mine! maternal rights serene
    Not given to another!
  The crystal bars shine faint between
    The souls of child and mother.

  XXVI.

  "Meanwhile," the mother cries, "content!
    Our love was well divided:
  Its sweetness following where she went,
    Its anguish stayed where I did.

  XXVII.

  "Well done of God, to halve the lot,
    And give her all the sweetness;
  To us, the empty room and cot,--
    To her, the Heaven's completeness.

  XXVIII.

  "To us, this grave,--to her, the rows
    The mystic palm-trees spring in;
  To us, the silence in the house,--
    To her, the choral singing.

  XXIX.

  "For her, to gladden in God's view,--
    For us, to hope and bear on.
  Grow, Lily, in thy garden new,
    Beside the Rose of Sharon!

  XXX.

  "Grow fast in heaven, sweet Lily clipped,
    In love more calm than this is,
  And may the angels dewy-lipped
    Remind thee of our kisses!

  XXXI.

  "While none shall tell thee of our tears,
    These human tears now falling,
  Till, after a few patient years,
    One home shall take us all in.

  XXXII.

  "Child, father, mother--who, left out?
    Not mother, and not father!
  And when, our dying couch about,
    The natural mists shall gather,

  XXXIII.

  "Some smiling angel close shall stand
    In old Correggio's fashion,
  And bear a LILY in his hand,
    For death's ANNUNCIATION."




CATARINA TO CAMOENS

(DYING IN HIS ABSENCE ABROAD, AND REFERRING TO THE POEM IN WHICH HE
RECORDED THE SWEETNESS OF HER EYES).


  I.

  On the door you will not enter,
    I have gazed too long: adieu!
  Hope withdraws her peradventure;
    Death is near me,--and not you.
        Come, O lover,
        Close and cover
  These poor eyes, you called, I ween,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  II.

  When I heard you sing that burden
    In my vernal days and bowers,
  Other praises disregarding,
    I but hearkened that of yours--
        Only saying
        In heart-playing,
  "Blessed eyes mine eyes have been,
  If the sweetest HIS have seen!"

  III.

  But all changes. At this vesper,
    Cold the sun shines down the door.
  If you stood there, would you whisper
    "Love, I love you," as before,--
        Death pervading
        Now, and shading
  Eyes you sang of, that yestreen,
  As the sweetest ever seen?

  IV.

  Yes. I think, were you beside them,
    Near the bed I die upon,
  Though their beauty you denied them,
    As you stood there, looking down,
        You would truly
        Call them duly,
  For the love's sake found therein,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  V.

  And if you looked down upon them,
    And if they looked up to you,
  All the light which has foregone them
    Would be gathered back anew:
        They would truly
        Be as duly
  Love-transformed to beauty's sheen,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  VI.

  But, ah me! you only see me,
    In your thoughts of loving man,
  Smiling soft perhaps and dreamy
    Through the wavings of my fan;
        And unweeting
        Go repeating,
  In your reverie serene,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen----"

  VII.

  While my spirit leans and reaches
    From my body still and pale,
  Fain to hear what tender speech is
    In your love to help my bale.
        O my poet,
        Come and show it!
  Come, of latest love, to glean
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  VIII.

  O my poet, O my prophet,
    When you praised their sweetness so,
  Did you think, in singing of it,
    That it might be near to go?
        Had you fancies
        From their glances,
  That the grave would quickly screen
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen"?

  IX.

  No reply. The fountain's warble
    In the courtyard sounds alone.
  As the water to the marble
    So my heart falls with a moan
        From love-sighing
        To this dying.
  Death forerunneth Love to win
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  X.

  Will you come? When I'm departed
    Where all sweetnesses are hid,
  Where thy voice, my tender-hearted,
    Will not lift up either lid.
        Cry, O lover,
        Love is over!
  Cry, beneath the cypress green,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  XI.

  When the angelus is ringing,
    Near the convent will you walk,
  And recall the choral singing
    Which brought angels down our talk?
        Spirit-shriven
        I viewed Heaven,
  Till you smiled--"Is earth unclean,
  Sweetest eyes were ever seen?"

  XII.

  When beneath the palace-lattice
    You ride slow as you have done,
  And you see a face there that is
    Not the old familiar one,--
        Will you oftly
        Murmur softly,
  "Here ye watched me morn and e'en,
  Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  XIII.

  When the palace-ladies, sitting
    Round your gittern, shall have said,
  "Poet, sing those verses written
    For the lady who is dead,"
        Will you tremble
        Yet dissemble,--
  Or sing hoarse, with tears between,
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen"?

  XIV.

  "Sweetest eyes!" how sweet in flowings
    The repeated cadence is!
  Though you sang a hundred poems,
    Still the best one would be this.
        I can hear it
        'Twixt my spirit
  And the earth-noise intervene--
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  XV.

  But the priest waits for the praying,
    And the choir are on their knees,
  And the soul must pass away in
    Strains more solemn-high than these.
        Miserere
        For the weary!
  Oh, no longer for Catrine
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  XVI.

  Keep my riband, take and keep it,
    (I have loosed it from my hair)[1]
  Feeling, while you overweep it,
    Not alone in your despair,
        Since with saintly
        Watch unfaintly
  Out of heaven shall o'er you lean
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  XVII.

  But--but now--yet unremovèd
    Up to heaven, they glisten fast;
  You may cast away, Belovèd,
    In your future all my past:
        Such old phrases
        May be praises
  For some fairer bosom-queen--
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"

  XVIII.

  Eyes of mine, what are ye doing?
    Faithless, faithless,--praised amiss
  If a tear be of your showing,
    Dropt for any hope of HIS!
        Death has boldness
        Besides coldness,
  If unworthy tears demean
  "Sweetest eyes were ever seen."

  XIX.

  I will look out to his future;
    I will bless it till it shine.
  Should he ever be a suitor
    Unto sweeter eyes than mine,
        Sunshine gild them,
        Angels shield them,
  Whatsoever eyes terrene
  Be the sweetest HIS have seen!


LIFE AND LOVE.


  I.

  Fast this Life of mine was dying,
    Blind already and calm as death,
  Snowflakes on her bosom lying
    Scarcely heaving with her breath.

  II.

  Love came by, and having known her
    In a dream of fabled lands,
  Gently stooped, and laid upon her
    Mystic chrism of holy hands;

  III.

  Drew his smile across her folded
    Eyelids, as the swallow dips;
  Breathed as finely as the cold did
    Through the locking of her lips.

  IV.

  So, when Life looked upward, being
    Warmed and breathed on from above,
  What sight could she have for seeing,
    Evermore ... but only LOVE?




A DENIAL.


  I.

  We have met late--it is too late to meet,
      O friend, not more than friend!
  Death's forecome shroud is tangled round my feet,
  And if I step or stir, I touch the end.
      In this last jeopardy
  Can I approach thee, I, who cannot move?
  How shall I answer thy request for love?
      Look in my face and see.

  II.

  I love thee not, I dare not love thee! go
      In silence; drop my hand.
  If thou seek roses, seek them where they blow
  In garden-alleys, not in desert-sand.
      Can life and death agree,
  That thou shouldst stoop thy song to my complaint?
  I cannot love thee. If the word is faint,
      Look in my face and see.

  III.

  I might have loved thee in some former days.
      Oh, then, my spirits had leapt
  As now they sink, at hearing thy love-praise!
  Before these faded cheeks were overwept,
      Had this been asked of me,
  To love thee with my whole strong heart and head,--
  I should have said still ... yes, but smiled and said,
      "Look in my face and see!"

  IV.

  But now ... God sees me, God, who took my heart
      And drowned it in life's surge.
  In all your wide warm earth I have no part--
  A light song overcomes me like a dirge.
      Could Love's great harmony
  The saints keep step to when their bonds are loose,
  Not weigh me down? am I a wife to choose?
      Look in my face and see--

  V.

  While I behold, as plain as one who dreams,
      Some woman of full worth,
  Whose voice, as cadenced as a silver stream's,
  Shall prove the fountain-soul which sends it forth;
      One younger, more thought-free
  And fair and gay, than I, thou must forget,
  With brighter eyes than these ... which are not wet ...
      Look in my face and see!

  VI.

  So farewell thou, whom I have known too late
      To let thee come so near.
  Be counted happy while men call thee great,
  And one belovèd woman feels thee dear!--
      Not I!--that cannot be.
  I am lost, I am changed,--I must go farther, where
  The change shall take me worse, and no one dare
      Look in my face and see.

  VII.

  Meantime I bless thee. By these thoughts of mine
      I bless thee from all such!
  I bless thy lamp to oil, thy cup to wine,
  Thy hearth to joy, thy hand to an equal touch
      Of loyal troth. For me,
  I love thee not, I love thee not!--away!
  Here's no more courage in my soul to say
      "Look in my face and see."




PROOF AND DISPROOF.


  I.

  Dost thou love me, my Belovèd?
    Who shall answer yes or no?
  What is provèd or disprovèd
    When my soul inquireth so,
  Dost thou love me, my Belovèd?

  II.

  I have seen thy heart to-day,
    Never open to the crowd,
  While to love me aye and aye
    Was the vow as it was vowed
  By thine eyes of steadfast grey.

  III.

  Now I sit alone, alone--
    And the hot tears break and burn,
  Now, Belovèd, thou art gone,
    Doubt and terror have their turn.
  Is it love that I have known?

  IV.

  I have known some bitter things,--
    Anguish, anger, solitude.
  Year by year an evil brings,
    Year by year denies a good;
  March winds violate my springs.

  V.

  I have known how sickness bends,
    I have known how sorrow breaks,--
  How quick hopes have sudden ends,
    How the heart thinks till it aches
  Of the smile of buried friends.

  VI.

  Last, I have known thee, my brave
    Noble thinker, lover, doer!
  The best knowledge last I have.
    But thou comest as the thrower
  Of fresh flowers upon a grave.

  VII.

  Count what feelings used to move me!
    Can this love assort with those?
  Thou, who art so far above me,
    Wilt thou stoop so, for repose?
  Is it true that thou canst love me?

  VIII.

  Do not blame me if I doubt thee.
    I can call love by its name
  When thine arm is wrapt about me;
    But even love seems not the same,
  When I sit alone, without thee.

  IX.

  In thy clear eyes I descried
    Many a proof of love, to-day;
  But to-night, those unbelied
    Speechful eyes being gone away,
  There's the proof to seek, beside.

  X.

  Dost thou love me, my Belovèd?
    Only thou canst answer yes!
  And, thou gone, the proof's disprovèd,
    And the cry rings answerless--
  Dost thou love me, my Belovèd?




QUESTION AND ANSWER.


  I.

  Love you seek for, presupposes
    Summer heat and sunny glow.
  Tell me, do you find moss-roses
    Budding, blooming in the snow?
  Snow might kill the rose-tree's root--
  Shake it quickly from your foot,
    Lest it harm you as you go.

  II.

  From the ivy where it dapples
    A grey ruin, stone by stone,
  Do you look for grapes or apples,
    Or for sad green leaves alone?
  Pluck the leaves off, two or three--
  Keep them for morality
    When you shall be safe and gone.




INCLUSIONS.


  I.

  Oh, wilt thou have my hand, Dear, to lie along in thine?
  As a little stone in a running stream, it seems to lie and pine.
  Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear, unfit to plight with thine.

  II.

  Oh, wilt thou have my cheek, Dear, drawn closer to thine own?
  My cheek is white, my cheek is worn, by many a tear run down.
  Now leave a little space, Dear, lest it should wet thine own.

  III.

  Oh, must thou have my soul, Dear, commingled with thy soul?--
  Red grows the cheek, and warm the hand; the part is in the whole:
  Nor hands nor cheeks keep separate, when soul is joined to soul.




INSUFFICIENCY.


  I.

  There is no one beside thee and no one above thee,
    Thou standest alone as the nightingale sings!
    And my words that would praise thee are impotent things,
  For none can express thee though all should approve thee.
    I love thee so, Dear, that I only can love thee.

  II.

  Say, what can I do for thee? weary thee, grieve thee?
    Lean on thy shoulder, new burdens to add?
    Weep my tears over thee, making thee sad?
  Oh, hold me not--love me not! let me retrieve thee.
    I love thee so, Dear, that I only can leave thee.




SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE


I.

  I thought once how Theocritus had sung
  Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,
  Who each one in a gracious hand appears
  To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
  And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
  I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
  The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
  Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
  A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
  So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
  Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;
  And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,--
  "Guess now who holds thee?"--"Death," I said. But, there,
  The silver answer rang,--"Not Death, but Love."


II.

  But only three in all God's universe
  Have heard this word thou hast said,--Himself, beside
  Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied
  One of us ... that was God, ... and laid the curse
  So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
  My sight from seeing thee,--that if I had died,
  The deathweights, placed there, would have signified
  Less absolute exclusion. "Nay" is worse
  From God than from all others, O my friend!
  Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
  Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
  Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
  And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
  We should but vow the faster for the stars.


III.

  Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!
  Unlike our uses and our destinies.
  Our ministering two angels look surprise
  On one another, as they strike athwart
  Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art
  A guest for queens to social pageantries,
  With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
  Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
  Of chief musician. What hast thou to do
  With looking from the lattice-lights at me,
  A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
  The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?
  The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew,--
  And Death must dig the level where these agree.


IV.

  Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,
  Most gracious singer of high poems! where
  The dancers will break footing, from the care
  Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.
  And dost thou lift this house's latch too poor
  For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear
  To let thy music drop here unaware
  In folds of golden fulness at my door?
  Look up and see the casement broken in,
  The bats and owlets builders in the roof!
  My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.
  Hush, call no echo up in further proof
  Of desolation! there's a voice within
  That weeps ... as thou must sing ... alone, aloof.


V.

  I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,
  As once Electra her sepulchral urn,
  And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn
  The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see
  What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,
  And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
  Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn
  Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
  It might be well perhaps. But if instead
  Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
  The grey dust up, ... those laurels on thine head,
  O my Belovèd, will not shield thee so,
  That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
  The hair beneath. Stand further off then! go.


VI.

  Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand
  Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
  Alone upon the threshold of my door
  Of individual life, I shall command
  The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
  Serenely in the sunshine as before,
  Without the sense of that which I forbore--
  Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
  Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
  With pulses that beat double. What I do
  And what I dream include thee, as the wine
  Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
  God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
  And sees within my eyes the tears of two.


VII.

  The face of all the world is changed, I think,
  Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
  Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole
  Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
  Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,
  Was caught up into love, and taught the whole
  Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole
  God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,
  And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.
  The names of country, heaven, are changed away
  For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;
  And this ... this lute and song ... loved yesterday,
  (The singing angels know) are only dear
  Because thy name moves right in what they say.


VIII.

  What can I give thee back, O liberal
  And princely giver, who hast brought the gold
  And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,
  And laid them on the outside of the wall
  For such as I to take or leave withal,
  In unexpected largesse? am I cold,
  Ungrateful, that for these most manifold
  High gifts, I render nothing back at all?
  Not so; not cold,--but very poor instead
  Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run
  The colours from my life, and left so dead
  And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
  To give the same as pillow to thy head.
  Go farther! let it serve to trample on.


IX.

  Can it be right to give what I can give?
  To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
  As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years
  Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
  Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
  For all thy adjurations? O my fears,
  That this can scarce be right! We are not peers,
  So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,
  That givers of such gifts as mine are, must
  Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!
  I will not soil thy purple with my dust,
  Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,
  Nor give thee any love--which were unjust.
  Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.


X.

  Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
  And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
  Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
  Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
  And love is fire. And when I say at need
  I love thee ... mark!... I love thee--in thy sight
  I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
  With conscience of the new rays that proceed
  Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
  In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
  Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
  And what I feel, across the inferior features
  Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
  How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.


XI.

  And therefore if to love can be desert,
  I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale
  As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
  To bear the burden of a heavy heart,--
  This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
  To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
  To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
  A melancholy music,--why advert
  To these things? O Belovèd, it is plain
  I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
  And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
  From that same love this vindicating grace,
  To live on still in love, and yet in vain,--
  To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.


XII.

  Indeed this very love which is my boast,
  And which, when rising up from breast to brow,
  Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
  To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,--
  This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,
  I should not love withal, unless that thou
  Hadst set me an example, shown me how,
  When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,
  And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak
  Of love even, as a good thing of my own:
  Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,
  And placed it by thee on a golden throne,--
  And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)
  Is by thee only, whom I love alone.


XIII.

  And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
  The love I bear thee, finding words enough,
  And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,
  Between our faces, to cast light on each?--
  I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach
  My hand to hold my spirit so far off
  From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof
  In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
  Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
  Commend my woman-love to thy belief,--
  Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,
  And rend the garment of my life, in brief,
  By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
  Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.


XIV.

  If thou must love me, let it be for nought
  Except for love's sake only. Do not say
  "I love her for her smile--her look--her way
  Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought
  That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
  A sense of pleasant ease on such a day"--
  For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may
  Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,
  May be unwrought so. Neither love me for
  Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--
  A creature might forget to weep, who bore
  Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
  But love me for love's sake, that evermore
  Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.


XV.

  Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
  Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
  For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
  With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
  On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
  As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
  Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine,
  And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
  Were most impossible failure, if I strove
  To fail so. But I look on thee--on thee--
  Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
  Hearing oblivion beyond memory;
  As one who sits and gazes from above,
  Over the rivers to the bitter sea.


XVI.

  And yet, because thou overcomest so,
  Because thou art more noble and like a king,
  Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
  Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
  Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
  How it shook when alone. Why, conquering
  May prove as lordly and complete a thing
  In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
  And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
  To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
  Even so, Belovèd, I at last record,
  Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth,
  I rise above abasement at the word.
  Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.


XVII.

  My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes
  God set between His After and Before,
  And strike up and strike off the general roar
  Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
  In a serene air purely. Antidotes
  Of medicated music, answering for
  Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour
  From thence into their ears. God's will devotes
  Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
  How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?
  A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine
  Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?
  A shade, in which to sing--of palm or pine?
  A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose.


XVIII.

  I never gave a lock of hair away
  To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
  Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
  I ring out to the full brown length and say
  "Take it." My day of youth went yesterday;
  My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
  Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
  As girls do, any more: it only may
  Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
  Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
  Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
  Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
  Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
  The kiss my mother left here when she died.


XIX.

  The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
  I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
  And from my poet's forehead to my heart
  Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,--
  As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
  The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
  The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, ...
  The bay-crown's shade, Belovèd, I surmise,
  Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
  Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
  I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
  And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
  Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
  No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.


XX.

  Beloved, my Belovèd, when I think
  That thou wast in the world a year ago,
  What time I sat alone here in the snow
  And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink
  No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,
  Went counting all my chains as if that so
  They never could fall off at any blow
  Struck by thy possible hand,--why, thus I drink
  Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful,
  Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
  With personal act or speech,--nor ever cull
  Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
  Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,
  Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.


XXI.

  Say over again, and yet once over again,
  That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated
  Should seem "a cuckoo-song," as thou dost treat it.
  Remember, never to the hill or plain,
  Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
  Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
  Belovèd, I, amid the darkness greeted
  By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain
  Cry, "Speak once more--thou lovest!" Who can fear
  Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
  Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
  Say thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll
  The silver iterance!--only minding, Dear,
  To love me also in silence with thy soul.


XXII.

  When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
  Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
  Until the lengthening wings break into fire
  At either curvèd point,--what bitter wrong
  Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
  Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,
  The angels would press on us and aspire
  To drop some golden orb of perfect song
  Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
  Rather on earth, Belovèd,--where the unfit
  Contrarious moods of men recoil away
  And isolate pure spirits, and permit
  A place to stand and love in for a day,
  With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.


XXIII.

  Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead,
  Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
  And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
  Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
  I marvelled, my Belovèd, when I read
  Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine--
  But ... so much to thee? Can I pour thy wine
  While my hands tremble? Then my soul, instead
  Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range.
  Then, love me, Love! look on me--breathe on me!
  As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
  For love, to give up acres and degree,
  I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
  My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee!


XXIV.

  Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife,
  Shut in upon itself and do no harm
  In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
  And let us hear no sound of human strife
  After the click of the shutting. Life to life--
  I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
  And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
  Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
  Are weak to injure. Very-whitely still
  The lilies of our lives may reassure
  Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
  Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer
  Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill.
  God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.


XXV.

  A heavy heart, Belovèd, have I borne
  From year to year until I saw thy face,
  And sorrow after sorrow took the place
  Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
  As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
  By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace
  Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace
  Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
  My heavy heart. Then thou didst bid me bring
  And let it drop adown thy calmly great
  Deep being! Fast it sinketh, as a thing
  Which its own nature doth precipitate,
  While thine doth close above it, mediating
  Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.


XXVI.

  I lived with visions for my company
  Instead of men and women, years ago,
  And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
  A sweeter music than they played to me.
  But soon their trailing purple was not free
  Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,
  And I myself grew faint and blind below
  Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come--to be,
  Belovèd, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,
  Their songs, their splendours (better, yet the same,
  As river-water hallowed into fonts),
  Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
  My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
  Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.


XXVII.

  My own Belovèd, who hast lifted me
  From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,
  And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown
  A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully
  Shines out again, as all the angels see,
  Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own,
  Who camest to me when the world was gone,
  And I who looked for only God, found thee!
  I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.
  As one who stands in dewless asphodel
  Looks backward on the tedious time he had
  In the upper life,--so I, with bosom-swell,
  Make witness, here, between the good and bad,
  That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.


XXVIII.

  My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!
  And yet they seem alive and quivering
  Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
  And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
  This said,--he wished to have me in his sight
  Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
  To come and touch my hand ... a simple thing,
  Yet I wept for it!--this, ... the paper's light ...
  Said, Dear, I love thee; and I sank and quailed
  As if God's future thundered on my past.
  This said, I am thine--and so its ink has paled
  With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
  And this ... O Love, thy words have ill availed
  If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!


XXIX.

  I think of thee!--my thoughts do twine and bud
  About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,
  Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see
  Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
  Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
  I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
  Who art dearer, better! Rather, instantly
  Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
  Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
  And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee
  Drop heavily down,--burst, shattered, everywhere!
  Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
  And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
  I do not think of thee--I am too near thee.


XXX.

  I see thine image through my tears to-night,
  And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How
  Refer the cause?--Belovèd, is it thou
  Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte
  Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
  May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
  On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,
  Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
  As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen.
  Belovèd, dost thou love? or did I see all
  The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
  Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
  For my soul's eyes? Will that light come again,
  As now these tears come--falling hot and real?


XXXI.

  Thou comest! all is said without a word.
  I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
  In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
  Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
  Yet prodigal inward joy. Behold, I erred
  In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue
  The sin most, but the occasion--that we two
  Should for a moment stand unministered
  By a mutual presence. Ah, keep near and close,
  Thou dovelike help! and, when my fears would rise,
  With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
  Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
  These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
  Like callow birds left desert to the skies.


XXXII.

  The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
  To love me, I looked forward to the moon
  To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
  And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
  Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
  And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
  For such man's love!--more like an out-of-tune
  Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
  To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
  Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
  I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
  A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
  'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,--
  And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.


XXXIII.

  Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear
  The name I used to run at, when a child,
  From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled,
  To glance up in some face that proved me dear
  With the look of its eyes. I miss the clear
  Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled
  Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,
  Call me no longer. Silence on the bier,
  While I call God--call God!--So let thy mouth
  Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
  Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
  And catch the early love up in the late.
  Yes, call me by that name,--and I, in truth,
  With the same heart, will answer and not wait.


XXXIV.

  With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee
  As those, when thou shalt call me by my name--
  Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
  Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?
  When called before, I told how hastily
  I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game,
  To run and answer with the smile that came
  At play last moment, and went on with me
  Through my obedience. When I answer now,
  I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
  Yet still my heart goes to thee--ponder how--
  Not as to a single good, but all my good!
  Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
  That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.


XXXV.

  If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
  And be all to me? Shall I never miss
  Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
  That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
  When I look up, to drop on a new range
  Of walls and floors, another home than this?
  Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
  Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change?
  That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,
  To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;
  For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
  Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
  Yet love me--wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,
  And fold within the wet wings of thy dove.


XXXVI.

  When we met first and loved, I did not build
  Upon the event with marble. Could it mean
  To last, a love set pendulous between
  Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled,
  Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
  The onward path, and feared to overlean
  A finger even. And, though I have grown serene
  And strong since then, I think that God has willed
  A still renewable fear ... O love, O troth ...
  Lest these enclaspèd hands should never hold,
  This mutual kiss drop down between us both
  As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.
  And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,
  Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.


XXXVII.

  Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make,
  Of all that strong divineness which I know
  For thine and thee, an image only so
  Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.
  It is that distant years which did not take
  Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,
  Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
  Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake
  Thy purity of likeness and distort
  Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit:
  As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,
  His guardian sea-god to commemorate,
  Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort
  And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.


XXXVIII.

  First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
  The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
  And ever since, it grew more clean and white,
  Slow to world-greetings, quick with its "Oh, list,"
  When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
  I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
  Than that first kiss. The second passed in height
  The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
  Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!
  That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,
  With sanctifying sweetness, did precede.
  The third upon my lips was folded down
  In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
  I have been proud and said, "My love, my own."


XXXIX.

  Because thou hast the power and own'st the grace
  To look through and behind this mask of me
  (Against which years have beat thus blanchingly
  With their rains), and behold my soul's true face,
  The dim and weary witness of life's race,--
  Because thou hast the faith and love to see,
  Through that same soul's distracting lethargy,
  The patient angel waiting for a place
  In the new Heavens,--because nor sin nor woe,
  Nor God's infliction, nor death's neighbourhood,
  Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
  Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,--
  Nothing repels thee, ... Dearest, teach me so
  To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!


XL.

  Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!
  I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth.
  I have heard love talked in my early youth,
  And since, not so long back but that the flowers
  Then gathered, smell still. Mussulmans and Giaours
  Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth
  For any weeping. Polypheme's white tooth
  Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,
  The shell is over-smooth,--and not so much
  Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate
  Or else to oblivion. But thou art not such
  A lover, my Belovèd! thou canst wait
  Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,
  And think it soon when others cry "Too late."


XLI.

  I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,
  With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all
  Who paused a little near the prison-wall
  To hear my music in its louder parts
  Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's
  Or temple's occupation, beyond call.
  But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall
  When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's
  Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
  To hearken what I said between my tears, ...
  Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot
  My soul's full meaning into future years,
  That they should lend it utterance, and salute
  Love that endures, from Life that disappears!


XLII.

  "My future will not copy fair my past"--
  I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
  My ministering life-angel justified
  The word by his appealing look upcast
  To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
  And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
  To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried
  By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
  While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff
  Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
  I seek no copy now of life's first half:
  Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
  And write me new my future's epigraph,
  New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!


XLIII.

  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
  I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
  My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
  For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
  I love thee to the level of everyday's
  Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
  I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
  I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
  I love thee with the passion put to use
  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
  I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
  With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,
  Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,
  I shall but love thee better after death.


XLIV.

  Belovèd, thou hast brought me many flowers
  Plucked in the garden, all the summer through
  And winter, and it seemed as if they grew
  In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
  So, in the like name of that love of ours,
  Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,
  And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
  From my heart's ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers
  Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,
  And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,
  Here's ivy!--take them, as I used to do
  Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
  Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,
  And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.




CASA GUIDI WINDOWS

A Poem, IN TWO PARTS


ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.


This poem contains the impressions of the writer upon events in
Tuscany of which she was a witness. "From a window," the critic may
demur. She bows to the objection in the very title of her work. No
continuous narrative nor exposition of political philosophy is
attempted by her. It is a simple story of personal impressions, whose
only value is in the intensity with which they were received, as
proving her warm affection for a beautiful and unfortunate country,
and the sincerity with which they are related, as indicating her own
good faith and freedom from partisanship.

Of the two parts of this poem, the first was written nearly three
years ago, while the second resumes the actual situation of 1851. The
discrepancy between the two parts is a sufficient guarantee to the
public of the truthfulness of the writer, who, though she certainly
escaped the epidemic "falling sickness" of enthusiasm for Pio Nono,
takes shame upon herself that she believed, like a woman, some royal
oaths, and lost sight of the probable consequences of some obvious
popular defects. If the discrepancy should be painful to the reader,
let him understand that to the writer it has been more so. But such
discrepancies we are called upon to accept at every hour by the
conditions of our nature, implying the interval between aspiration
and performance, between faith and disillusion, between hope and
fact.

  "O trusted broken prophecy,
  O richest fortune sourly crost,
  Born for the future, to the future lost!"

Nay, not lost to the future in this case. The future of Italy shall
not be disinherited.

FLORENCE, 1851.




CASA GUIDI WINDOWS.


PART I.

  I heard last night a little child go singing
    'Neath Casa Guidi windows, by the church,
  O bella libertà, O bella!--stringing
    The same words still on notes he went in search
  So high for, you concluded the upspringing
    Of such a nimble bird to sky from perch
  Must leave the whole bush in a tremble green,
    And that the heart of Italy must beat,
  While such a voice had leave to rise serene
    'Twixt church and palace of a Florence street:
  A little child, too, who not long had been
    By mother's finger steadied on his feet,
  And still O bella libertà he sang.

  Then I thought, musing, of the innumerous
    Sweet songs which still for Italy outrang
  From older singers' lips who sang not thus
    Exultingly and purely, yet, with pang
  Fast sheathed in music, touched the heart of us
    So finely that the pity scarcely pained.
  I thought how Filicaja led on others,
    Bewailers for their Italy enchained,
  And how they called her childless among mothers,
    Widow of empires, ay, and scarce refrained
  Cursing her beauty to her face, as brothers
    Might a shamed sister's,--"Had she been less fair
  She were less wretched;"--how, evoking so
    From congregated wrong and heaped despair
  Of men and women writhing under blow,
    Harrowed and hideous in a filthy lair,
  Some personating Image wherein woe
    Was wrapt in beauty from offending much,
  They called it Cybele, or Niobe,
    Or laid it corpse-like on a bier for such,
  Where all the world might drop for Italy
    Those cadenced tears which burn not where they touch,--
  "Juliet of nations, canst thou die as we?
    And was the violet crown that crowned thy head
  So over-large, though new buds made it rough,
    It slipped down and across thine eyelids dead,
  O sweet, fair Juliet?" Of such songs enough,
    Too many of such complaints! behold, instead,
  Void at Verona, Juliet's marble trough:[2]
    As void as that is, are all images
  Men set between themselves and actual wrong,
    To catch the weight of pity, meet the stress
  Of conscience,--since 't is easier to gaze long
    On mournful masks and sad effigies
  Than on real, live, weak creatures crushed by strong.

    For me who stand in Italy to-day
  Where worthier poets stood and sang before,
    I kiss their footsteps yet their words gainsay.
  I can but muse in hope upon this shore
    Of golden Arno as it shoots away
  Through Florence' heart beneath her bridges four:
    Bent bridges, seeming to strain off like bows,
  And tremble while the arrowy undertide
    Shoots on and cleaves the marble as it goes,
  And strikes up palace-walls on either side,
    And froths the cornice out in glittering rows,
  With doors and windows quaintly multiplied,
    And terrace-sweeps, and gazers upon all,
  By whom if flower or kerchief were thrown out
    From any lattice there, the same would fall
  Into the river underneath, no doubt,
    It runs so close and fast 'twixt wall and wall.
  How beautiful! the mountains from without
    In silence listen for the word said next.
  What word will men say,--here where Giotto planted
    His campanile like an unperplexed
  Fine question Heavenward, touching the things granted
    A noble people who, being greatly vexed
  In act, in aspiration keep undaunted?
    What word will God say? Michel's Night and Day
  And Dawn and Twilight wait in marble scorn[3]
    Like dogs upon a dunghill, couched on clay
  From whence the Medicean stamp's outworn,
    The final putting off of all such sway
  By all such hands, and freeing of the unborn
    In Florence and the great world outside Florence.
  Three hundred years his patient statues wait
    In that small chapel of the dim Saint Lawrence:
  Day's eyes are breaking bold and passionate
    Over his shoulder, and will flash abhorrence
  On darkness and with level looks meet fate,
    When once loose from that marble film of theirs;
  The Night has wild dreams in her sleep, the Dawn
    Is haggard as the sleepless, Twilight wears
  A sort of horror; as the veil withdrawn
    'Twixt the artist's soul and works had left them heirs
  Of speechless thoughts which would not quail nor fawn,
    Of angers and contempts, of hope and love:
  For not without a meaning did he place
    The princely Urbino on the seat above
  With everlasting shadow on his face,
    While the slow dawns and twilights disapprove
  The ashes of his long-extinguished race
    Which never more shall clog the feet of men.
  I do believe, divinest Angelo,
    That winter-hour in Via Larga, when
  They bade thee build a statue up in snow[4]
    And straight that marvel of thine art again
  Dissolved beneath the sun's Italian glow,
    Thine eyes, dilated with the plastic passion,
  Thawing too in drops of wounded manhood, since,
    To mock alike thine art and indignation,
  Laughed at the palace-window the new prince,--
    ("Aha! this genius needs for exaltation,
  When all's said and however the proud may wince,
    A little marble from our princely mines!")
  I do believe that hour thou laughedst too
    For the whole sad world and for thy Florentines,
  After those few tears, which were only few!
    That as, beneath the sun, the grand white lines
  Of thy snow-statue trembled and withdrew,--
    The head, erect as Jove's, being palsied first,
  The eyelids flattened, the full brow turned blank,
    The right-hand, raised but now as if it cursed,
  Dropt, a mere snowball, (till the people sank
    Their voices, though a louder laughter burst
  From the royal window)--thou couldst proudly thank
    God and the prince for promise and presage,
  And laugh the laugh back, I think verily,
    Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage
  To read a wrong into a prophecy,
    And measure a true great man's heritage
  Against a mere great-duke's posterity.
    I think thy soul said then, "I do not need
  A princedom and its quarries, after all;
    For if I write, paint, carve a word, indeed,
  On book or board or dust, on floor or wall,
    The same is kept of God who taketh heed
  That not a letter of the meaning fall
    Or ere it touch and teach His world's deep heart,
  Outlasting, therefore, all your lordships, sir!
    So keep your stone, beseech you, for your part,
  To cover up your grave-place and refer
    The proper titles; I live by my art.
  The thought I threw into this snow shall stir
    This gazing people when their gaze is done;
  And the tradition of your act and mine,
    When all the snow is melted in the sun,
  Shall gather up, for unborn men, a sign
    Of what is the true princedom,--ay, and none
  Shall laugh that day, except the drunk with wine."

    Amen, great Angelo! the day's at hand.
  If many laugh not on it, shall we weep?
    Much more we must not, let us understand.
  Through rhymers sonneteering in their sleep
    And archaists mumbling dry bones up the land
  And sketchers lauding ruined towns a-heap,--
    Through all that drowsy hum of voices smooth,
  The hopeful bird mounts carolling from brake,
    The hopeful child, with leaps to catch his growth,
  Sings open-eyed for liberty's sweet sake:
    And I, a singer also from my youth,
  Prefer to sing with these who are awake,
    With birds, with babes, with men who will not fear
  The baptism of the holy morning dew,
    (And many of such wakers now are here,
  Complete in their anointed manhood, who
    Will greatly dare and greatlier persevere,)
  Than join those old thin voices with my new,
    And sigh for Italy with some safe sigh
  Cooped up in music 'twixt an oh and ah,--
    Nay, hand in hand with that young child, will I
  Go singing rather, "Bella libertà,"
    Than, with those poets, croon the dead or cry
  "Se tu men bella fossi, Italia!"

    "Less wretched if less fair." Perhaps a truth
  Is so far plain in this, that Italy,
    Long trammelled with the purple of her youth
  Against her age's ripe activity,
    Sits still upon her tombs, without death's ruth
  But also without life's brave energy.
    "Now tell us what is Italy?" men ask:
  And others answer, "Virgil, Cicero,
    Catullus, Cæsar." What beside? to task
  The memory closer--"Why, Boccaccio,
    Dante, Petrarca,"--and if still the flask
  Appears to yield its wine by drops too slow,--
    "Angelo, Raffael, Pergolese,"--all
  Whose strong hearts beat through stone, or charged again
    The paints with fire of souls electrical,
  Or broke up heaven for music. What more then?
    Why, then, no more. The chaplet's last beads fall
  In naming the last saintship within ken,
    And, after that, none prayeth in the land.
  Alas, this Italy has too long swept
    Heroic ashes up for hour-glass sand;
  Of her own past, impassioned nympholept!
    Consenting to be nailed here by the hand
  To the very bay-tree under which she stept
    A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch;
  And, licensing the world too long indeed
    To use her broad phylacteries to staunch
  And stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed
    How one clear word would draw an avalanche
  Of living sons around her, to succeed
    The vanished generations. Can she count
  These oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths
    Agape for macaroni, in the amount
  Of consecrated heroes of her south's
    Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount,
  The gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes
    To let the ground-leaves of the place confer
  A natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem
    No nation, but the poet's pensioner,
  With alms from every land of song and dream,
    While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her
  Until their proper breaths, in that extreme
    Of sighing, split the reed on which they played:
  Of which, no more. But never say "no more"
    To Italy's life! Her memories undismayed
  Still argue "evermore;" her graves implore
    Her future to be strong and not afraid;
  Her very statues send their looks before.

    We do not serve the dead--the past is past.
  God lives, and lifts His glorious mornings up
    Before the eyes of men awake at last,
  Who put away the meats they used to sup,
    And down upon the dust of earth outcast
  The dregs remaining of the ancient cup,
    Then turn to wakeful prayer and worthy act.
  The Dead, upon their awful 'vantage ground,
    The sun not in their faces, shall abstract
  No more our strength; we will not be discrowned
    As guardians of their crowns, nor deign transact
  A barter of the present, for a sound
    Of good so counted in the foregone days.
  O Dead, ye shall no longer cling to us
    With rigid hands of desiccating praise,
  And drag us backward by the garment thus,
    To stand and laud you in long-drawn virelays!
  We will not henceforth be oblivious
    Of our own lives, because ye lived before,
  Nor of our acts, because ye acted well.
    We thank you that ye first unlatched the door,
  But will not make it inaccessible
    By thankings on the threshold any more.
  We hurry onward to extinguish hell
    With our fresh souls, our younger hope, and God's
  Maturity of purpose. Soon shall we
    Die also! and, that then our periods
  Of life may round themselves to memory
    As smoothly as on our graves the burial-sods,
  We now must look to it to excel as ye,
    And bear our age as far, unlimited
  By the last mind-mark; so, to be invoked
    By future generations, as their Dead.

  'T is true that when the dust of death has choked
    A great man's voice, the common words he said
  Turn oracles, the common thoughts he yoked
    Like horses, draw like griffins: this is true
  And acceptable. I, too, should desire,
    When men make record, with the flowers they strew,
  "Savonarola's soul went out in fire
    Upon our Grand-duke's piazza,[5] and burned through
  A moment first, or ere he did expire,
    The veil betwixt the right and wrong, and showed
  How near God sat and judged the judges there,--"
    Upon the self-same pavement overstrewed
  To cast my violets with as reverent care,
    And prove that all the winters which have snowed
  Cannot snow out the scent from stones and air,
    Of a sincere man's virtues. This was he,
  Savonarola, who, while Peter sank
    With his whole boat-load, called courageously
  "Wake Christ, wake Christ!"--who, having tried the tank
    Of old church-waters used for baptistry
  Ere Luther came to spill them, swore they stank;
    Who also by a princely deathbed cried,
  "Loose Florence, or God will not loose thy soul!"
    Then fell back the Magnificent and died
  Beneath the star-look shooting from the cowl,
    Which turned to wormwood-bitterness the wide
  Deep sea of his ambitions. It were foul
    To grudge Savonarola and the rest
  Their violets: rather pay them quick and fresh!
    The emphasis of death makes manifest
  The eloquence of action in our flesh;
    And men who, living, were but dimly guessed,
  When once free from their life's entangled mesh,
    Show their full length in graves, or oft indeed
  Exaggerate their stature, in the flat,
    To noble admirations which exceed
  Most nobly, yet will calculate in that
    But accurately. We, who are the seed
  Of buried creatures, if we turned and spat
    Upon our antecedents, we were vile.
  Bring violets rather. If these had not walked
    Their furlong, could we hope to walk our mile?
  Therefore bring violets. Yet if we self-baulked
    Stand still, a-strewing violets all the while,
  These moved in vain, of whom we have vainly talked.
    So rise up henceforth with a cheerful smile,
  And having strewn the violets, reap the corn,
    And having reaped and garnered, bring the plough
  And draw new furrows 'neath the healthy morn,
    And plant the great Hereafter in this Now.

  Of old 't was so. How step by step was worn,
    As each man gained on each securely!--how
  Each by his own strength sought his own Ideal,--
    The ultimate Perfection leaning bright
  From out the sun and stars to bless the leal
    And earnest search of all for Fair and Right
  Through doubtful forms by earth accounted real!
    Because old Jubal blew into delight
  The souls of men with clear-piped melodies,
    If youthful Asaph were content at most
  To draw from Jubal's grave, with listening eyes,
    Traditionary music's floating ghost
  Into the grass-grown silence, were it wise?
    And was 't not wiser, Jubal's breath being lost,
  That Miriam clashed her cymbals to surprise
    The sun between her white arms flung apart,
  With new glad golden sounds? that David's strings
    O'erflowed his hand with music from his heart?
  So harmony grows full from many springs,
    And happy accident turns holy art.

  You enter, in your Florence wanderings,
    The church of Saint Maria Novella. Pass
  The left stair, where at plague-time Machiavel[6]
    Saw One with set fair face as in a glass,
  Dressed out against the fear of death and hell,
    Rustling her silks in pauses of the mass,
  To keep the thought off how her husband fell,
    When she left home, stark dead across her feet,--
  The stair leads up to what the Orgagnas save
    Of Dante's dæmons; you, in passing it,
  Ascend the right stair from the farther nave
    To muse in a small chapel scarcely lit
  By Cimabue's Virgin. Bright and brave,
    That picture was accounted, mark, of old:
  A king stood bare before its sovran grace,[7]
    A reverent people shouted to behold
  The picture, not the king, and even the place
    Containing such a miracle grew bold,
  Named the Glad Borgo from that beauteous face
    Which thrilled the artist, after work, to think
  His own ideal Mary-smile should stand
    So very near him,--he, within the brink
  Of all that glory, let in by his hand
    With too divine a rashness! Yet none shrink
  Who come to gaze here now; albeit 't was planned
    Sublimely in the thought's simplicity:
  The Lady, throned in empyreal state,
    Minds only the young Babe upon her knee,
  While sidelong angels bear the royal weight,
    Prostrated meekly, smiling tenderly
  Oblivion of their wings; the Child thereat
    Stretching its hand like God. If any should,
  Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints,
    Gaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood
  On Cimabue's picture,--Heaven anoints
    The head of no such critic, and his blood
  The poet's curse strikes full on and appoints
    To ague and cold spasms for evermore.
  A noble picture! worthy of the shout
    Wherewith along the streets the people bore
  Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out
    Until they stooped and entered the church door.
  Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about,
    Whom Cimabue found among the sheep,[8]
  And knew, as gods know gods, and carried home
    To paint the things he had painted, with a deep
  And fuller insight, and so overcome
    His chapel-Lady with a heavenlier sweep
  Of light: for thus we mount into the sum
    Of great things known or acted. I hold, too,
  That Cimabue smiled upon the lad
    At the first stroke which passed what he could do,
  Or else his Virgin's smile had never had
    Such sweetness in 't. All great men who foreknew
  Their heirs in art, for art's sake have been glad,
    And bent their old white heads as if uncrowned,
  Fanatics of their pure Ideals still
    Far more than of their triumphs, which were found
  With some less vehement struggle of the will.
    If old Margheritone trembled, swooned
  And died despairing at the open sill
    Of other men's achievements (who achieved,
  By loving art beyond the master), he
    Was old Margheritone, and conceived
  Never, at first youth and most ecstasy,
    A Virgin like that dream of one, which heaved
  The death-sigh from his heart. If wistfully
    Margheritone sickened at the smell
  Of Cimabue's laurel, let him go!
    For Cimabue stood up very well
  In spite of Giotto's, and Angelico
    The artist-saint kept smiling in his cell
  The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow
    Inbreak of angels (whitening through the dim
  That he might paint them), while the sudden sense
    Of Raffael's future was revealed to him
  By force of his own fair works' competence.
    The same blue waters where the dolphins swim
  Suggest the tritons. Through the blue Immense
    Strike out, all swimmers! cling not in the way
  Of one another, so to sink; but learn
    The strong man's impulse, catch the freshening spray
  He throws up in his motions, and discern
    By his clear westering eye, the time of day.
  Thou, God, hast set us worthy gifts to earn
    Besides Thy heaven and Thee! and when I say
  There's room here for the weakest man alive
    To live and die, there's room too, I repeat,
  For all the strongest to live well, and strive
    Their own way, by their individual heat,--
  Like some new bee-swarm leaving the old hive,
    Despite the wax which tempts so violet-sweet.
  Then let the living live, the dead retain
    Their grave-cold flowers!--though honour's best supplied
  By bringing actions, to prove theirs not vain.

    Cold graves, we say? it shall be testified
  That living men who burn in heart and brain,
    Without the dead were colder. If we tried
  To sink the past beneath our feet, be sure
    The future would not stand. Precipitate
  This old roof from the shrine, and, insecure,
    The nesting swallows fly off, mate from mate.
  How scant the gardens, if the graves were fewer!
    The tall green poplars grew no longer straight
  Whose tops not looked to Troy. Would any fight
    For Athens, and not swear by Marathon?
  Who dared build temples, without tombs in sight?
    Or live, without some dead man's benison?
  Or seek truth, hope for good, and strive for right,
    If, looking up, he saw not in the sun
  Some angel of the martyrs all day long
    Standing and waiting? Your last rhythm will need
  Your earliest key-note. Could I sing this song,
    If my dead masters had not taken heed
  To help the heavens and earth to make me strong,
    As the wind ever will find out some reed
  And touch it to such issues as belong
    To such a frail thing? None may grudge the Dead
  Libations from full cups. Unless we choose
    To look back to the hills behind us spread,
  The plains before us sadden and confuse;
    If orphaned, we are disinherited.

  I would but turn these lachrymals to use,
    And pour fresh oil in from the olive-grove,
  To furnish them as new lamps. Shall I say
    What made my heart beat with exulting love
  A few weeks back?--
                      The day was such a day
    As Florence owes the sun. The sky above,
  Its weight upon the mountains seemed to lay,
    And palpitate in glory, like a dove
  Who has flown too fast, full-hearted--take away
    The image! for the heart of man beat higher
  That day in Florence, flooding all her streets
    And piazzas with a tumult and desire.
  The people, with accumulated heats
    And faces turned one way, as if one fire
  Both drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats
    And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall
  To thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course,
    Had graciously permitted, at their call,
  The citizens to use their civic force
    To guard their civic homes. So, one and all,
  The Tuscan cities streamed up to the source
    Of this new good at Florence, taking it
  As good so far, presageful of more good,--
    The first torch of Italian freedom, lit
  To toss in the next tiger's face who should
    Approach too near them in a greedy fit,--
  The first pulse of an even flow of blood
    To prove the level of Italian veins
  Towards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed
    From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains
  Of orderly procession--banners raised,
    And intermittent bursts of martial strains
  Which died upon the shout, as if amazed
    By gladness beyond music--they passed on!
  The Magistracy, with insignia, passed,--
    And all the people shouted in the sun,
  And all the thousand windows which had cast
    A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down
  (As if the houses overflowed at last),
    Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes.
  The Lawyers passed,--and still arose the shout,
    And hands broke from the windows to surprise
  Those grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out.
    The Priesthood passed,--the friars with worldly-wise
  Keen sidelong glances from their beards about
    The street to see who shouted; many a monk
  Who takes a long rope in the waist, was there:
    Whereat the popular exultation drunk
  With indrawn "vivas" the whole sunny air,
    While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk
  A cloud of kerchiefed hands,--"The church makes fair
    Her welcome in the new Pope's name." Ensued
  The black sign of the "Martyrs"--(name no name,
    But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed
  The Artists; next, the Trades; and after came
    The People,--flag and sign, and rights as good--
  And very loud the shout was for that same
    Motto, "Il popolo." IL POPOLO,--
  The word means dukedom, empire, majesty,
    And kings in such an hour might read it so.
  And next, with banners, each in his degree,
    Deputed representatives a-row
  Of every separate state of Tuscany:
    Siena's she-wolf, bristling on the fold
  Of the first flag, preceded Pisa's hare,
    And Massa's lion floated calm in gold,
  Pienza's following with his silver stare,
    Arezzo's steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,--
  And well might shout our Florence, greeting there
    These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent
  The various children of her teeming flanks--
    Greeks, English, French--as if to a parliament
  Of lovers of her Italy in ranks,
    Each bearing its land's symbol reverent;
  At which the stones seemed breaking into thanks
    And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof
  Arose; the very house-walls seemed to bend;
    The very windows, up from door to roof,
  Flashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend
    With passionate looks the gesture's whirling off
  A hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end
    While all these passed; and ever in the crowd,
  Rude men, unconscious of the tears that kept
    Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud,
  And none asked any why they laughed and wept:
    Friends kissed each other's cheeks, and foes long vowed
  More warmly did it; two-months' babies leapt
    Right upward in their mother's arms, whose black
  Wide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed
    Each before either, neither glancing back;
  And peasant maidens smoothly 'tired and tressed
    Forgot to finger on their throats the slack
  Great pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest,
    But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes
  Along the stones, and smiled as if they saw.
    O heaven, I think that day had noble use
  Among God's days! So near stood Right and Law,
    Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise
  Nor Right deny, and each in reverent awe
    Honoured the other. And if, ne'ertheless,
  That good day's sun delivered to the vines
    No charta, and the liberal Duke's excess
  Did scarce exceed a Guelf's or Ghibelline's
    In any special actual righteousness
  Of what that day he granted, still the signs
    Are good and full of promise, we must say,
  When multitudes approach their kings with prayers
    And kings concede their people's right to pray
  Both in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs,
    So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay
  When men from humble homes and ducal chairs
    Hate wrong together. It was well to view
  Those banners ruffled in a ruler's face
    Inscribed, "Live freedom, union, and all true
  Brave patriots who are aided by God's grace!"
    Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew
  His little children to the window-place
    He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest
  They too should govern as the people willed.
    What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best,
  Declared his eyes filled up and overfilled
    With good warm human tears which unrepressed
  Ran down. I like his face; the forehead's build
    Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps
  Sufficient comprehension,--mild and sad,
    And careful nobly,--not with care that wraps
  Self-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad,
    But careful with the care that shuns a lapse
  Of faith and duty, studious not to add
    A burden in the gathering of a gain.
  And so, God save the Duke, I say with those
    Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign,
  May all wear in the visible overflows
    Of spirit, such a look of careful pain!
  For God must love it better than repose.

  And all the people who went up to let
    Their hearts out to that Duke, as has been told--
  Where guess ye that the living people met,
    Kept tryst, formed ranks, chose leaders, first unrolled
  Their banners?
                  In the Loggia? where is set
    Cellini's godlike Perseus, bronze or gold,
  (How name the metal, when the statue flings
    Its soul so in your eyes?) with brow and sword
  Superbly calm, as all opposing things,
    Slain with the Gorgon, were no more abhorred
  Since ended?
                  No, the people sought no wings
    From Perseus in the Loggia, nor implored
  An inspiration in the place beside
    From that dim bust of Brutus, jagged and grand,
  Where Buonarroti passionately tried
    From out the close-clenched marble to demand
  The head of Rome's sublimest homicide,
    Then dropt the quivering mallet from his hand,
  Despairing he could find no model-stuff
    Of Brutus in all Florence where he found
  The gods and gladiators thick enough.
    Nor there! the people chose still holier ground:
  The people, who are simple, blind and rough,
    Know their own angels, after looking round.
  Whom chose they then? where met they?

                                  On the stone
    Called Dante's,--a plain flat stone scarce discerned
  From others in the pavement,--whereupon
    He used to bring his quiet chair out, turned
  To Brunelleschi's church, and pour alone
    The lava of his spirit when it burned:
  It is not cold to-day. O passionate
    Poor Dante who, a banished Florentine,
  Didst sit austere at banquets of the great
    And muse upon this far-off stone of thine
  And think how oft some passer used to wait
    A moment, in the golden day's decline,
  With "Good night, dearest Dante!"--well, good night!
    I muse now, Dante, and think verily,
  Though chapelled in the byeway out of sight,
    Ravenna's bones would thrill with ecstasy,
  Couldst know thy favourite stone's elected right
    As tryst-place for thy Tuscans to foresee
  Their earliest chartas from. Good night, good morn,
    Henceforward, Dante! now my soul is sure
  That thine is better comforted of scorn,
    And looks down earthward in completer cure
  Than when, in Santa Croce church forlorn
    Of any corpse, the architect and hewer
  Did pile the empty marbles as thy tomb.[9]
    For now thou art no longer exiled, now
  Best honoured: we salute thee who art come
    Back to the old stone with a softer brow
  Than Giotto drew upon the wall, for some
    Good lovers of our age to track and plough[10]
  Their way to, through time's ordures stratified,
    And startle broad awake into the dull
  Bargello chamber: now thou'rt milder-eyed,--
    Now Beatrix may leap up glad to cull
  Thy first smile, even in heaven and at her side,
    Like that which, nine years old, looked beautiful
  At May-game. What do I say? I only meant
    That tender Dante loved his Florence well,
  While Florence, now, to love him is content;
    And, mark ye, that the piercingest sweet smell
  Of love's dear incense by the living sent
    To find the dead, is not accessible
  To lazy livers--no narcotic,--not
    Swung in a censer to a sleepy tune,--
  But trod out in the morning air by hot
    Quick spirits who tread firm to ends foreshown,
  And use the name of greatness unforgot,
    To meditate what greatness may be done.

  For Dante sits in heaven and ye stand here,
    And more remains for doing, all must feel,
  Than trysting on his stone from year to year
    To shift processions, civic toe to heel,
  The town's thanks to the Pitti. Are ye freer
    For what was felt that day? a chariot-wheel
  May spin fast, yet the chariot never roll.
    But if that day suggested something good,
  And bettered, with one purpose, soul by soul,--
    Better means freer. A land's brotherhood
  Is most puissant: men, upon the whole,
    Are what they can be,--nations, what they would.

  Will therefore, to be strong, thou Italy!
    Will to be noble! Austrian Metternich
  Can fix no yoke unless the neck agree;
    And thine is like the lion's when the thick
  Dews shudder from it, and no man would be
    The stroker of his mane, much less would prick
  His nostril with a reed. When nations roar
    Like lions, who shall tame them and defraud
  Of the due pasture by the river-shore?
    Roar, therefore! shake your dewlaps dry abroad:
  The amphitheatre with open door
    Leads back upon the benches who applaud
  The last spear-thruster.

                            Yet the Heavens forbid
    That we should call on passion to confront
  The brutal with the brutal and, amid
    This ripening world, suggest a lion-hunt
  And lion's-vengeance for the wrongs men did
    And do now, though the spears are getting blunt.
  We only call, because the sight and proof
    Of lion-strength hurts nothing; and to show
  A lion-heart, and measure paw with hoof,
    Helps something, even, and will instruct a foe
  As well as the onslaught, how to stand aloof:
    Or else the world gets past the mere brute blow
  Or given or taken. Children use the fist
    Until they are of age to use the brain;
  And so we needed Cæsars to assist
    Man's justice, and Napoleons to explain
  God's counsel, when a point was nearly missed,
    Until our generations should attain
  Christ's stature nearer. Not that we, alas,
    Attain already; but a single inch
  Will raise to look down on the swordsman's pass.
    As knightly Roland on the coward's flinch:
  And, after chloroform and ether-gas,
    We find out slowly what the bee and finch
  Have ready found, through Nature's lamp in each,
    How to our races we may justify
  Our individual claims and, as we reach
    Our own grapes, bend the top vines to supply
  The children's uses,--how to fill a breach
    With olive-branches,--how to quench a lie
  With truth, and smite a foe upon the cheek
    With Christ's most conquering kiss. Why, these are things
  Worth a great nation's finding, to prove weak
    The "glorious arms" of military kings.
  And so with wide embrace, my England, seek
    To stifle the bad heat and flickerings
  Of this world's false and nearly expended fire!
    Draw palpitating arrows to the wood,
  And twang abroad thy high hopes and thy higher
    Resolves, from that most virtuous altitude!
  Till nations shall unconsciously aspire
    By looking up to thee, and learn that good
  And glory are not different. Announce law
    By freedom; exalt chivalry by peace;
  Instruct how clear calm eyes can overawe,
    And how pure hands, stretched simply to release
  A bond-slave, will not need a sword to draw
    To be held dreadful. O my England, crease
  Thy purple with no alien agonies,
    No struggles toward encroachment, no vile war!
  Disband thy captains, change thy victories,
    Be henceforth prosperous as the angels are,
  Helping, not humbling.

                            Drums and battle-cries
    Go out in music of the morning-star--
  And soon we shall have thinkers in the place
    Of fighters, each found able as a man
  To strike electric influence through a race,
    Unstayed by city-wall and barbican.
  The poet shall look grander in the face
    Than even of old (when he of Greece began
  To sing "that Achillean wrath which slew
    So many heroes")--seeing he shall treat
  The deeds of souls heroic toward the true,
    The oracles of life, previsions sweet
  And awful like divine swans gliding through
    White arms of Ledas, which will leave the heat
  Of their escaping godship to endue
    The human medium with a heavenly flush.

  Meanwhile, in this same Italy we want
    Not popular passion, to arise and crush,
  But popular conscience, which may covenant
    For what it knows. Concede without a blush,
  To grant the "civic guard" is not to grant
    The civic spirit, living and awake:
  Those lappets on your shoulders, citizens,
    Your eyes strain after sideways till they ache
  (While still, in admirations and amens,
    The crowd comes up on festa-days to take
  The great sight in)--are not intelligence,
    Not courage even--alas, if not the sign
  Of something very noble, they are nought;
    For every day ye dress your sallow kine
  With fringes down their cheeks, though unbesought
    They loll their heavy heads and drag the wine
  And bear the wooden yoke as they were taught
    The first day. What ye want is light--indeed
  Not sunlight--(ye may well look up surprised
    To those unfathomable heavens that feed
  Your purple hills)--but God's light organized
    In some high soul, crowned capable to lead
  The conscious people, conscious and advised,--
    For if we lift a people like mere clay,
  It falls the same. We want thee, O unfound
    And sovran teacher! if thy beard be grey
  Or black, we bid thee rise up from the ground
    And speak the word God giveth thee to say,
  Inspiring into all this people round,
    Instead of passion, thought, which pioneers
  All generous passion, purifies from sin,
    And strikes the hour for. Rise up, teacher! here's
  A crowd to make a nation!--best begin
    By making each a man, till all be peers
  Of earth's true patriots and pure martyrs in
    Knowing and daring. Best unbar the doors
  Which Peter's heirs keep locked so overclose
    They only let the mice across the floors,
  While every churchman dangles, as he goes,
    The great key at his girdle, and abhors
  In Christ's name, meekly. Open wide the house,
    Concede the entrance with Christ's liberal mind,
  And set the tables with His wine and bread.
    What! "commune in both kinds?" In every kind--
  Wine, wafer, love, hope, truth, unlimited,
    Nothing kept back. For when a man is blind
  To starlight, will he see the rose is red?
    A bondsman shivering at a Jesuit's foot--
  "Væ! meâ culpâ!"--is not like to stand
    A freedman at a despot's and dispute
  His titles by the balance in his hand,
    Weighing them "suo jure." Tend the root
  If careful of the branches, and expand
    The inner souls of men before you strive
  For civic heroes.

                        But the teacher, where?
    From all these crowded faces, all alive,
  Eyes, of their own lids flashing themselves bare,
    And brows that with a mobile life contrive
  A deeper shadow,--may we in no wise dare
    To put a finger out and touch a man,
  And cry "this is the leader"? What, all these!
    Broad heads, black eyes,--yet not a soul that ran
  From God down with a message? All, to please
    The donna waving measures with her fan,
  And not the judgment-angel on his knees
    (The trumpet just an inch off from his lips),
  Who when he breathes next, will put out the sun?

    Yet mankind's self were foundered in eclipse,
  If lacking doers, with great works to be done;
    And lo, the startled earth already dips
  Back into light; a better day's begun;
    And soon this leader, teacher, will stand plain,
  And build the golden pipes and synthesize
    This people-organ for a holy strain.
  We hold this hope, and still in all these eyes
    Go sounding for the deep look which shall drain
  Suffused thought into channelled enterprise.
    Where is the teacher? What now may he do,
  Who shall do greatly? Doth he gird his waist
    With a monk's rope, like Luther? or pursue
  The goat, like Tell? or dry his nets in haste,
    Like Masaniello when the sky was blue?
  Keep house, like other peasants, with inlaced
    Bare brawny arms about a favourite child,
  And meditative looks beyond the door
    (But not to mark the kidling's teeth have filed
  The green shoots of his vine which last year bore
    Full twenty bunches), or, on triple-piled
  Throne-velvets sit at ease to bless the poor,
    Like other pontiffs, in the Poorest's name?
  The old tiara keeps itself aslope
    Upon his steady brows which, all the same,
  Bend mildly to permit the people's hope?

    Whatever hand shall grasp this oriflamme,
  Whatever man (last peasant or first pope
    Seeking to free his country) shall appear,
  Teach, lead, strike fire into the masses, fill
    These empty bladders with fine air, insphere
  These wills into a unity of will,
    And make of Italy a nation--dear
  And blessed be that man! the Heavens shall kill
    No leaf the earth lets grow for him, and Death
  Shall cast him back upon the lap of Life
    To live more surely, in a clarion-breath
  Of hero-music. Brutus with the knife,
    Rienzi with the fasces, throb beneath
  Rome's stones,--and more who threw away joy's fife
    Like Pallas, that the beauty of their souls
  Might ever shine untroubled and entire:
    But if it can be true that he who rolls
  The Church's thunders will reserve her fire
    For only light,--from eucharistic bowls
  Will pour new life for nations that expire,
    And rend the scarlet of his papal vest
  To gird the weak loins of his countrymen,--
    I hold that he surpasses all the rest
  Of Romans, heroes, patriots; and that when
    He sat down on the throne, he dispossessed
  The first graves of some glory. See again,
    This country-saving is a glorious thing:
  And if a common man achieved it? well.
    Say, a rich man did? excellent. A king?
  That grows sublime. A priest? improbable.
    A pope? Ah, there we stop, and cannot bring
  Our faith up to the leap, with history's bell
    So heavy round the neck of it--albeit
  We fain would grant the possibility
    For thy sake, Pio Nono!

                                    Stretch thy feet
  In that case--I will kiss them reverently
    As any pilgrim to the papal seat:
  And, such proved possible, thy throne to me
    Shall seem as holy a place as Pellico's
  Venetian dungeon, or as Spielberg's grate
    At which the Lombard woman hung the rose
  Of her sweet soul by its own dewy weight,
    To feel the dungeon round her sunshine close,
  And pining so, died early, yet too late
    For what she suffered. Yea, I will not choose
  Betwixt thy throne, Pope Pius, and the spot
    Marked red for ever, spite of rains and dews,
  Where Two fell riddled by the Austrian's shot,
    The brothers Bandiera, who accuse,
  With one same mother-voice and face (that what
    They speak may be invincible) the sins
  Of earth's tormentors before God the just,
    Until the unconscious thunderbolt begins
  To loosen in His grasp.

                            And yet we must
    Beware, and mark the natural kiths and kins
  Of circumstance and office, and distrust
    The rich man reasoning in a poor man's hut,
  The poet who neglects pure truth to prove
    Statistic fact, the child who leaves a rut
  For a smoother road, the priest who vows his glove
    Exhales no grace, the prince who walks afoot,
  The woman who has sworn she will not love,
    And this Ninth Pius in Seventh Gregory's chair,
  With Andrea Doria's forehead!

                                Count what goes
    To making up a pope, before he wear
  That triple crown. We pass the world-wide throes
    Which went to make the popedom,--the despair
  Of free men, good men, wise men; the dread shows
    Of women's faces, by the faggot's flash
  Tossed out, to the minutest stir and throb
    O' the white lips, the least tremble of a lash,
  To glut the red stare of a licensed mob;
    The short mad cries down oubliettes, and plash
  So horribly far off; priests, trained to rob,
    And kings that, like encouraged nightmares, sat
  On nations' hearts most heavily distressed
    With monstrous sights and apophthegms of fate--
  We pass these things,--because "the times" are prest
    With necessary charges of the weight
  Of all this sin, and "Calvin, for the rest,
    Made bold to burn Servetus. Ah, men err!"--
  And so do churches! which is all we mean
    To bring to proof in any register
  Of theological fat kine and lean:
    So drive them back into the pens! refer
  Old sins (with pourpoint, "quotha" and "I ween")
    Entirely to the old times, the old times;
  Nor ever ask why this preponderant
    Infallible pure Church could set her chimes
  Most loudly then, just then,--most jubilant,
    Precisely then, when mankind stood in crimes
  Full heart-deep, and Heaven's judgments were not scant.
    Inquire still less, what signifies a church
  Of perfect inspiration and pure laws
    Who burns the first man with a brimstone-torch,
  And grinds the second, bone by bone, because
    The times, forsooth, are used to rack and scorch!
  What is a holy Church unless she awes
    The times down from their sins? Did Christ select
  Such amiable times to come and teach
    Love to, and mercy? The whole world were wrecked
  If every mere great man, who lives to reach
    A little leaf of popular respect,
  Attained not simply by some special breach
    In the age's customs, by some precedence
  In thought and act, which, having proved him higher
    Than those he lived with, proved his competence
  In helping them to wonder and aspire.

    My words are guiltless of the bigot's sense;
  My soul has fire to mingle with the fire
    Of all these souls, within or out of doors
  Of Rome's church or another. I believe
    In one Priest, and one temple with its floors
  Of shining jasper gloom'd at morn and eve
    By countless knees of earnest auditors,
  And crystal walls too lucid to perceive,
    That none may take the measure of the place
  And say "So far the porphyry, then, the flint--
    To this mark mercy goes, and there ends grace,"
  Though still the permeable crystals hint
    At some white starry distance, bathed in space.
  I feel how nature's ice-crusts keep the dint
    Of undersprings of silent Deity.
  I hold the articulated gospels which
    Show Christ among us crucified on tree.
  I love all who love truth, if poor or rich
    In what they have won of truth possessively.
  No altars and no hands defiled with pitch
    Shall scare me off, but I will pray and eat
  With all these--taking leave to choose my ewers--
    And say at last "Your visible churches cheat
  Their inward types; and, if a church assures
    Of standing without failure and defeat,
  The same both fails and lies."

                                  To leave which lures
    Of wider subject through past years,--behold,
  We come back from the popedom to the pope,
    To ponder what he must be, ere we are bold
  For what he may be, with our heavy hope
    To trust upon his soul. So, fold by fold,
  Explore this mummy in the priestly cope,
    Transmitted through the darks of time, to catch
  The man within the wrappage, and discern
    How he, an honest man, upon the watch
  Full fifty years for what a man may learn,
    Contrived to get just there; with what a snatch
  Of old-world oboli he had to earn
    The passage through; with what a drowsy sop,
  To drench the busy barkings of his brain;
    What ghosts of pale tradition, wreathed with hop
  'Gainst wakeful thought, he had to entertain
    For heavenly visions; and consent to stop
  The clock at noon, and let the hour remain
    (Without vain windings-up) inviolate
  Against all chimings from the belfry. Lo,
    From every given pope you must abate,
  Albeit you love him, some things--good, you know--
    Which every given heretic you hate,
  Assumes for his, as being plainly so.
    A pope must hold by popes a little,--yes,
  By councils, from Nicæa up to Trent,--
    By hierocratic empire, more or less
  Irresponsible to men,--he must resent
    Each man's particular conscience, and repress
  Inquiry, meditation, argument,
    As tyrants faction. Also, he must not
  Love truth too dangerously, but prefer
    "The interests of the Church" (because a blot
  Is better than a rent, in miniver)--
    Submit to see the people swallow hot
  Husk-porridge, which his chartered churchmen stir
    Quoting the only true God's epigraph,
  "Feed my lambs, Peter!"--must consent to sit
    Attesting with his pastoral ring and staff
  To such a picture of our Lady, hit
    Off well by artist-angels (though not half
  As fair as Giotto would have painted it)--
    To such a vial, where a dead man's blood
  Runs yearly warm beneath a churchman's finger,--
    To such a holy house of stone and wood,
  Whereof a cloud of angels was the bringer
    From Bethlehem to Loreto. Were it good
  For any pope on earth to be a flinger
    Of stones against these high-niched counterfeits?
  Apostates only are iconoclasts.
    He dares not say, while this false thing abets
  That true thing, "This is false." He keeps his fasts
    And prayers, as prayer and fast were silver frets
  To change a note upon a string that lasts,
    And make a lie a virtue. Now, if he
  Did more than this, higher hoped, and braver dared,
    I think he were a pope in jeopardy,
  Or no pope rather, for his truth had barred
    The vaulting of his life,--and certainly,
  If he do only this, mankind's regard
    Moves on from him at once, to seek some new
  Teacher and leader. He is good and great
    According to the deeds a pope can do;
  Most liberal, save those bonds; affectionate,
    As princes may be, and, as priests are, true;
  But only the Ninth Pius after eight,
    When all's praised most. At best and hopefullest,
  He's pope--we want a man! his heart beats warm,
    But, like the prince enchanted to the waist,
  He sits in stone and hardens by a charm
    Into the marble of his throne high-placed.
  Mild benediction waves his saintly arm--
    So, good! but what we want's a perfect man,
  Complete and all alive: half travertine
    Half suits our need, and ill subserves our plan.
  Feet, knees, nerves, sinews, energies divine
    Were never yet too much for men who ran
  In such hard ways as must be this of thine,
    Deliverer whom we seek, whoe'er thou art,
  Pope, prince, or peasant! If, indeed, the first,
    The noblest, therefore! since the heroic heart
  Within thee must be great enough to burst
    Those trammels buckling to the baser part
  Thy saintly peers in Rome, who crossed and cursed
    With the same finger.

                            Come, appear, be found,
  If pope or peasant, come! we hear the cock,
    The courtier of the mountains when first crowned
  With golden dawn; and orient glories flock
    To meet the sun upon the highest ground.
  Take voice and work! we wait to hear thee knock
    At some one of our Florentine nine gates,
  On each of which was imaged a sublime
    Face of a Tuscan genius, which, for hate's
  And love's sake, both, our Florence in her prime
    Turned boldly on all comers to her states,
  As heroes turned their shields in antique time
    Emblazoned with honourable acts. And though
  The gates are blank now of such images,
    And Petrarch looks no more from Nicolo
  Toward dear Arezzo, 'twixt the acacia-trees,
    Nor Dante, from gate Gallo--still we know,
  Despite the razing of the blazonries,
    Remains the consecration of the shield:
  The dead heroic faces will start out
    On all these gates, if foes should take the field,
  And blend sublimely, at the earliest shout,
    With living heroes who will scorn to yield
  A hair's-breadth even, when, gazing round about,
    They find in what a glorious company
  They fight the foes of Florence. Who will grudge
    His one poor life, when that great man we see
  Has given five hundred years, the world being judge,
    To help the glory of his Italy?
  Who, born the fair side of the Alps, will budge,
    When Dante stays, when Ariosto stays,
  When Petrarch stays for ever? Ye bring swords,
    My Tuscans? Ay, if wanted in this haze,
  Bring swords: but first bring souls!--bring thoughts and words,
    Unrusted by a tear of yesterday's,
  Yet awful by its wrong,--and cut these cords,
    And mow this green lush falseness to the roots,
  And shut the mouth of hell below the swathe!
    And, if ye can bring songs too, let the lute's
  Recoverable music softly bathe
    Some poet's hand, that, through all bursts and bruits
  Of popular passion, all unripe and rathe
    Convictions of the popular intellect,
  Ye may not lack a finger up the air,
    Annunciative, reproving, pure, erect,
  To show which way your first Ideal bare
    The whiteness of its wings when (sorely pecked
  By falcons on your wrists) it unaware
    Arose up overhead and out of sight.

  Meanwhile, let all the far ends of the world
    Breathe back the deep breath of their old delight,
  To swell the Italian banner just unfurled.
    Help, lands of Europe! for, if Austria fight,
  The drums will bar your slumber. Had ye curled
    The laurel for your thousand artists' brows,
  If these Italian hands had planted none?
    Can any sit down idle in the house
  Nor hear appeals from Buonarroti's stone
    And Raffael's canvas, rousing and to rouse?
  Where's Poussin's master? Gallic Avignon
    Bred Laura, and Vaucluse's fount has stirred
  The heart of France too strongly, as it lets
    Its little stream out (like a wizard's bird
  Which bounds upon its emerald wing and wets
    The rocks on each side), that she should not gird
  Her loins with Charlemagne's sword when foes beset
    The country of her Petrarch. Spain may well
  Be minded how from Italy she caught,
    To mingle with her tinkling Moorish bell,
  A fuller cadence and a subtler thought.
    And even the New World, the receptacle
  Of freemen, may send glad men, as it ought,
    To greet Vespucci Amerigo's door.
  While England claims, by trump of poetry,
    Verona, Venice, the Ravenna-shore,
  And dearer holds John Milton's Fiesole
    Than Langland's Malvern with the stars in flower.

  And Vallombrosa, we two went to see
    Last June, beloved companion,--where sublime
  The mountains live in holy families,
    And the slow pinewoods ever climb and climb
  Half up their breasts, just stagger as they seize
    Some grey crag, drop back with it many a time,
  And straggle blindly down the precipice.
    The Vallombrosan brooks were strewn as thick
  That June-day, knee-deep with dead beechen leaves,
    As Milton saw them ere his heart grew sick
  And his eyes blind. I think the monks and beeves
    Are all the same too: scarce have they changed the wick
  On good Saint Gualbert's altar which receives
    The convent's pilgrims; and the pool in front
  (Wherein the hill-stream trout are cast, to wait
    The beatific vision and the grunt
  Used at refectory) keeps its weedy state,
    To baffle saintly abbots who would count
  The fish across their breviary nor 'bate
    The measure of their steps. O waterfalls
  And forests! sound and silence! mountains bare
    That leap up peak by peak and catch the palls
  Of purple and silver mist to rend and share
    With one another, at electric calls
  Of life in the sunbeams,--till we cannot dare
    Fix your shapes, count your number! we must think
  Your beauty and your glory helped to fill
    The cup of Milton's soul so to the brink,
  He never more was thirsty when God's will
    Had shattered to his sense the last chain-link
  By which he had drawn from Nature's visible
    The fresh well-water. Satisfied by this,
  He sang of Adam's paradise and smiled,
    Remembering Vallombrosa. Therefore is
  The place divine to English man and child,
    And pilgrims leave their souls here in a kiss.

  For Italy's the whole earth's treasury, piled
    With reveries of gentle ladies, flung
  Aside, like ravelled silk, from life's worn stuff;
    With coins of scholars' fancy, which, being rung
  On work-day counter, still sound silver-proof;
    In short, with all the dreams of dreamers young,
  Before their heads have time for slipping off
    Hope's pillow to the ground. How oft, indeed,
  We've sent our souls out from the rigid north,
    On bare white feet which would not print nor bleed,
  To climb the Alpine passes and look forth,
    Where booming low the Lombard rivers lead
  To gardens, vineyards, all a dream is worth,--
    Sights, thou and I, Love, have seen afterward
  From Tuscan Bellosguardo, wide awake,[11]
    When, standing on the actual blessed sward
  Where Galileo stood at nights to take
    The vision of the stars, we have found it hard,
  Gazing upon the earth and heaven, to make
    A choice of beauty.

                        Therefore let us all
  Refreshed in England or in other land,
    By visions, with their fountain-rise and fall,
  Of this earth's darling,--we, who understand
    A little how the Tuscan musical
  Vowels do round themselves as if they planned
    Eternities of separate sweetness,--we,
  Who loved Sorrento vines in picture-book,
    Or ere in wine-cup we pledged faith or glee,--
  Who loved Rome's wolf with demi-gods at suck,
    Or ere we loved truth's own divinity,--
  Who loved, in brief, the classic hill and brook,
    And Ovid's dreaming tales and Petrarch's song,
  Or ere we loved Love's self even,--let us give
    The blessing of our souls (and wish them strong
  To bear it to the height where prayers arrive,
    When faithful spirits pray against a wrong,)
  To this great cause of southern men who strive
    In God's name for man's rights, and shall not fail.

  Behold, they shall not fail. The shouts ascend
    Above the shrieks, in Naples, and prevail.
  Rows of shot corpses, waiting for the end
    Of burial, seem to smile up straight and pale
  Into the azure air and apprehend
    That final gun-flash from Palermo's coast
  Which lightens their apocalypse of death.
    So let them die! The world shows nothing lost;
  Therefore, not blood. Above or underneath,
    What matter, brothers, if ye keep your post
  On duty's side? As sword returns to sheath,
    So dust to grave, but souls find place in Heaven.
  Heroic daring is the true success,
    The eucharistic bread requires no leaven;
  And though your ends were hopeless, we should bless
    Your cause as holy. Strive--and, having striven,
  Take, for God's recompense, that righteousness!



PART II.

  I wrote a meditation and a dream,
    Hearing a little child sing in the street:
  I leant upon his music as a theme,
    Till it gave way beneath my heart's full beat
  Which tried at an exultant prophecy
    But dropped before the measure was complete--
  Alas, for songs and hearts! O Tuscany,
    O Dante's Florence, is the type too plain?
  Didst thou, too, only sing of liberty
    As little children take up a high strain
  With unintentioned voices, and break off
    To sleep upon their mothers' knees again?
  Couldst thou not watch one hour? then, sleep enough--
    That sleep may hasten manhood and sustain
  The faint pale spirit with some muscular stuff.

    But we, who cannot slumber as thou dost,
  We thinkers, who have thought for thee and failed,
    We hopers, who have hoped for thee and lost,
  We poets, wandered round by dreams,[12] who hailed
    From this Atrides' roof (with lintel-post
  Which still drips blood,--the worse part hath prevailed)
    The fire-voice of the beacons to declare
  Troy taken, sorrow ended,--cozened through
    A crimson sunset in a misty air,
  What now remains for such as we, to do?
    God's judgments, peradventure, will He bare
  To the roots of thunder, if we kneel and sue?

    From Casa Guidi windows I looked forth,
  And saw ten thousand eyes of Florentines
    Flash back the triumph of the Lombard north,--
  Saw fifty banners, freighted with the signs
    And exultations of the awakened earth,
  Float on above the multitude in lines,
    Straight to the Pitti. So, the vision went.
  And so, between those populous rough hands
    Raised in the sun, Duke Leopold outleant,
  And took the patriot's oath which henceforth stands
    Among the oaths of perjurers, eminent
  To catch the lightnings ripened for these lands.

    Why swear at all, thou false Duke Leopold?
  What need to swear? What need to boast thy blood
    Unspoilt of Austria, and thy heart unsold
  Away from Florence? It was understood
    God made thee not too vigorous or too bold;
  And men had patience with thy quiet mood,
    And women, pity, as they saw thee pace
  Their festive streets with premature grey hairs.
    We turned the mild dejection of thy face
  To princely meanings, took thy wrinkling cares
    For ruffling hopes, and called thee weak, not base.
  Nay, better light the torches for more prayers
    And smoke the pale Madonnas at the shrine,
  Being still "our poor Grand-duke, our good Grand-duke,
    Who cannot help the Austrian in his line,"--
  Than write an oath upon a nation's book
    For men to spit at with scorn's blurring brine!
  Who dares forgive what none can overlook?

    For me, I do repent me in this dust
  Of towns and temples which makes Italy,--
    I sigh amid the sighs which breathe a gust
  Of dying century to century
    Around us on the uneven crater-crust
  Of these old worlds,--I bow my soul and knee.
    Absolve me, patriots, of my woman's fault
  That ever I believed the man was true!
    These sceptred strangers shun the common salt,
  And, therefore, when the general board's in view
    And they stand up to carve for blind and halt,
  The wise suspect the viands which ensue.
    I much repent that, in this time and place
  Where many corpse-lights of experience burn
    From Cæsar's and Lorenzo's festering race,
  To enlighten groping reasoners, I could learn
    No better counsel for a simple case
  Than to put faith in princes, in my turn.
    Had all the death-piles of the ancient years
  Flared up in vain before me? knew I not
    What stench arises from some purple gears?
  And how the sceptres witness whence they got
    Their briar-wood, crackling through the atmosphere's
  Foul smoke, by princely perjuries, kept hot?
    Forgive me, ghosts of patriots,--Brutus, thou,
  Who trailest downhill into life again
    Thy blood-weighed cloak, to indict me with thy slow
  Reproachful eyes!--for being taught in vain
    That, while the illegitimate Cæsars show
  Of meaner stature than the first full strain
    (Confessed incompetent to conquer Gaul),
  They swoon as feebly and cross Rubicons
    As rashly as any Julius of them all!
  Forgive, that I forgot the mind which runs
    Through absolute races, too unsceptical!
  I saw the man among his little sons,
    His lips were warm with kisses while he swore;
  And I, because I am a woman--I,
    Who felt my own child's coming life before
  The prescience of my soul, and held faith high,--
    I could not bear to think, whoever bore,
  That lips, so warmed, could shape so cold a lie.

    From Casa Guidi windows I looked out,
  Again looked, and beheld a different sight.
    The Duke had fled before the people's shout
  "Long live the Duke!" A people, to speak right,
    Must speak as soft as courtiers, lest a doubt
  Should curdle brows of gracious sovereigns, white.
    Moreover that same dangerous shouting meant
  Some gratitude for future favours, which
    Were only promised, the Constituent
  Implied, the whole being subject to the hitch
    In "motu proprios," very incident
  To all these Czars, from Paul to Paulovitch.
    Whereat the people rose up in the dust
  Of the ruler's flying feet, and shouted still
    And loudly; only, this time, as was just,
  Not "Live the Duke," who had fled for good or ill,
    But "Live the People," who remained and must,
  The unrenounced and unrenounceable.
    Long live the people! How they lived! and boiled
  And bubbled in the cauldron of the street:
    How the young blustered, nor the old recoiled,
  And what a thunderous stir of tongues and feet
    Trod flat the palpitating bells and foiled
  The joy-guns of their echo, shattering it!
    How down they pulled the Duke's arms everywhere!
  How up they set new café-signs, to show
    Where patriots might sip ices in pure air--
  (The fresh paint smelling somewhat)! To and fro
    How marched the civic guard, and stopped to stare
  When boys broke windows in a civic glow!
    How rebel songs were sung to loyal tunes,
  And bishops cursed in ecclesiastic metres:
    How all the Circoli grew large as moons,
  And all the speakers, moonstruck,--thankful greeters
    Of prospects which struck poor the ducal boons,
  A mere free Press, and Chambers!--frank repeaters
    Of great Guerazzi's praises--"There's a man,
  The father of the land, who, truly great,
    Takes off that national disgrace and ban,
  The farthing tax upon our Florence-gate,
    And saves Italia as he only can!"
  How all the nobles fled, and would not wait,
    Because they were most noble,--which being so,
  How Liberals vowed to burn their palaces,
    Because free Tuscans were not free to go!
  How grown men raged at Austria's wickedness,
    And smoked,--while fifty striplings in a row
  Marched straight to Piedmont for the wrong's redress!
    You say we failed in duty, we who wore
  Black velvet like Italian democrats,
    Who slashed our sleeves like patriots, nor forswore
  The true republic in the form of hats?
    We chased the archbishop from the Duomo door,
  We chalked the walls with bloody caveats
    Against all tyrants. If we did not fight
  Exactly, we fired muskets up the air
    To show that victory was ours of right.
  We met, had free discussion everywhere
    (Except perhaps i' the Chambers) day and night.
  We proved the poor should be employed, ... that's fair,--
    And yet the rich not worked for anywise,--
  Pay certified, yet payers abrogated,--
    Full work secured, yet liabilities
  To overwork excluded,--not one bated
    Of all our holidays, that still, at twice
  Or thrice a week, are moderately rated.
    We proved that Austria was dislodged, or would
  Or should be, and that Tuscany in arms
    Should, would dislodge her, ending the old feud;
  And yet, to leave our piazzas, shops, and farms,
    For the simple sake of fighting, was not good--
  We proved that also. "Did we carry charms
    Against being killed ourselves, that we should rush
  On killing others? what, desert herewith
    Our wives and mothers?--was that duty? tush!"
  At which we shook the sword within the sheath
    Like heroes--only louder; and the flush
  Ran up the cheek to meet the future wreath.
    Nay, what we proved, we shouted--how we shouted
  (Especially the boys did), boldly planting
    That tree of liberty, whose fruit is doubted,
  Because the roots are not of nature's granting!
    A tree of good and evil: none, without it,
  Grow gods; alas and, with it, men are wanting!

    O holy knowledge, holy liberty,
  O holy rights of nations! If I speak
    These bitter things against the jugglery
  Of days that in your names proved blind and weak,
    It is that tears are bitter. When we see
  The brown skulls grin at death in churchyards bleak,
    We do not cry "This Yorick is too light,"
  For death grows deathlier with that mouth he makes.
    So with my mocking: bitter things I write
  Because my soul is bitter for your sakes,
    O freedom! O my Florence!

                                Men who might
  Do greatly in a universe that breaks
    And burns, must ever know before they do.
  Courage and patience are but sacrifice;
    And sacrifice is offered for and to
  Something conceived of. Each man pays a price
    For what himself counts precious, whether true
  Or false the appreciation it implies.
    But here,--no knowledge, no conception, nought!
  Desire was absent, that provides great deeds
    From out the greatness of prevenient thought:
  And action, action, like a flame that needs
    A steady breath and fuel, being caught
  Up, like a burning reed from other reeds,
    Flashed in the empty and uncertain air,
  Then wavered, then went out. Behold, who blames
    A crooked course, when not a goal is there
  To round the fervid striving of the games?
    An ignorance of means may minister
  To greatness, but an ignorance of aims
    Makes it impossible to be great at all.
  So with our Tuscans! Let none dare to say,
    "Here virtue never can be national;
  Here fortitude can never cut a way
    Between the Austrian muskets, out of thrall:"
  I tell you rather that, whoever may
    Discern true ends here, shall grow pure enough
  To love them, brave enough to strive for them,
    And strong to reach them though the roads be rough:
  That having learnt--by no mere apophthegm--
    Not just the draping of a graceful stuff
  About a statue, broidered at the hem,--
    Not just the trilling on an opera-stage
  Of "libertà" to bravos--(a fair word,
    Yet too allied to inarticulate rage
  And breathless sobs, for singing, though the chord
    Were deeper than they struck it) but the gauge
  Of civil wants sustained and wrongs abhorred,
    The serious sacred meaning and full use
  Of freedom for a nation,--then, indeed,
    Our Tuscans, underneath the bloody dews
  Of some new morning, rising up agreed
    And bold, will want no Saxon souls or thews
  To sweep their piazzas clear of Austria's breed.

    Alas, alas! it was not so this time.
  Conviction was not, courage failed, and truth
    Was something to be doubted of. The mime
  Changed masks, because a mime. The tide as smooth
    In running in as out, no sense of crime
  Because no sense of virtue,--sudden ruth
    Seized on the people: they would have again
  Their good Grand-duke and leave Guerazzi, though
    He took that tax from Florence. "Much in vain
  He takes it from the market-carts, we trow,
    While urgent that no market-men remain,
  But all march off and leave the spade and plough,
    To die among the Lombards. Was it thus
  The dear paternal Duke did? Live the Duke!"
    At which the joy-bells multitudinous,
  Swept by an opposite wind, as loudly shook.
    Call back the mild archbishop to his house,
  To bless the people with his frightened look,--
    He shall not yet be hanged, you comprehend!
  Seize on Guerazzi; guard him in full view,
    Or else we stab him in the back, to end!
  Rub out those chalked devices, set up new
    The Duke's arms, doff your Phrygian caps, and men
  The pavement of the piazzas broke into
    By barren poles of freedom: smooth the way
  For the ducal carriage, lest his highness sigh
    "Here trees of liberty grew yesterday!"
  "Long live the Duke!"--how roared the cannonry,
    How rocked the bell-towers, and through thickening spray
  Of nosegays, wreaths, and kerchiefs tossed on high,
    How marched the civic guard, the people still
  Being good at shouts, especially the boys!
    Alas, poor people, of an unfledged will
  Most fitly expressed by such a callow voice!
    Alas, still poorer Duke, incapable
  Of being worthy even of so much noise!

    You think he came back instantly, with thanks
  And tears in his faint eyes, and hands extended
    To stretch the franchise through their utmost ranks?
  That having, like a father, apprehended,
    He came to pardon fatherly those pranks
  Played out and now in filial service ended?--
    That some love-token, like a prince, he threw
  To meet the people's love-call, in return?
    Well, how he came I will relate to you;
  And if your hearts should burn, why, hearts must burn,
    To make the ashes which things old and new
  Shall be washed clean in--as this Duke will learn.

    From Casa Guidi windows gazing, then,
  I saw and witness how the Duke came back.
    The regular tramp of horse and tread of men
  Did smite the silence like an anvil black
    And sparkless. With her wide eyes at full strain,
  Our Tuscan nurse exclaimed "Alack, alack,
    Signora! these shall be the Austrians." "Nay,
  Be still," I answered, "do not wake the child!"
    --For so, my two-months' baby sleeping lay
  In milky dreams upon the bed and smiled,
    And I thought "He shall sleep on, while he may,
  Through the world's baseness: not being yet defiled,
    Why should he be disturbed by what is done?"
  Then, gazing, I beheld the long-drawn street
    Live out, from end to end, full in the sun,
  With Austria's thousand; sword and bayonet,
    Horse, foot, artillery,--cannons rolling on
  Like blind slow storm-clouds gestant with the heat
    Of undeveloped lightnings, each bestrode
  By a single man, dust-white from head to heel,
    Indifferent as the dreadful thing he rode,
  Like a sculptured Fate serene and terrible.
    As some smooth river which has overflowed
  Will slow and silent down its current wheel
    A loosened forest, all the pines erect,
  So swept, in mute significance of storm,
    The marshalled thousands; not an eye deflect
  To left or right, to catch a novel form
    Of Florence city adorned by architect
  And carver, or of Beauties live and warm
    Scared at the casements,--all, straightforward eyes
  And faces, held as steadfast as their swords,
    And cognizant of acts, not imageries.
  The key, O Tuscans, too well fits the wards!
    Ye asked for mimes,--these bring you tragedies:
  For purple,--these shall wear it as your lords.
    Ye played like children,--die like innocents.
  Ye mimicked lightnings with a torch,--the crack
    Of the actual bolt, your pastime circumvents.
  Ye called up ghosts, believing they were slack
    To follow any voice from Gilboa's tents, ...
  Here's Samuel!--and, so, Grand-dukes come back!

    And yet, they are no prophets though they come:
  That awful mantle, they are drawing close,
    Shall be searched, one day, by the shafts of Doom
  Through double folds now hoodwinking the brows.
    Resuscitated monarchs disentomb
  Grave-reptiles with them, in their new life-throes.
    Let such beware. Behold, the people waits,
  Like God: as He, in His serene of might,
    So they, in their endurance of long straits.
  Ye stamp no nation out, though day and night
    Ye tread them with that absolute heel which grates
  And grinds them flat from all attempted height.
    You kill worms sooner with a garden-spade
  Than you kill peoples: peoples will not die;
    The tail curls stronger when you lop the head:
  They writhe at every wound and multiply
    And shudder into a heap of life that's made
  Thus vital from God's own vitality.
    'T is hard to shrivel back a day of God's
  Once fixed for judgment: 't is as hard to change
    The peoples, when they rise beneath their loads
  And heave them from their backs with violent wrench
    To crush the oppressor; for that judgment-rod's
  The measure of this popular revenge.

    Meanwhile, from Casa Guidi windows, we
  Beheld the armament of Austria flow
    Into the drowning heart of Tuscany:
  And yet none wept, none cursed, or, if 't was so,
    They wept and cursed in silence. Silently
  Our noisy Tuscans watched the invading foe;
    They had learnt silence. Pressed against the wall,
  And grouped upon the church-steps opposite,
    A few pale men and women stared at all.
  God knows what they were feeling, with their white
    Constrainèd faces, they, so prodigal
  Of cry and gesture when the world goes right,
    Or wrong indeed. But here was depth of wrong,
  And here, still water; they were silent here;
    And through that sentient silence, struck along
  That measured tramp from which it stood out clear,
    Distinct the sound and silence, like a gong
  At midnight, each by the other awfuller,--
    While every soldier in his cap displayed
  A leaf of olive. Dusty, bitter thing!
    Was such plucked at Novara, is it said?

  A cry is up in England, which doth ring
    The hollow world through, that for ends of trade
  And virtue and God's better worshipping,
    We henceforth should exalt the name of Peace
  And leave those rusty wars that eat the soul,--
    Besides their clippings at our golden fleece.
  I, too, have loved peace, and from bole to bole
    Of immemorial undeciduous trees
  Would write, as lovers use upon a scroll,
    The holy name of Peace and set it high
  Where none could pluck it down. On trees, I say,--
    Not upon gibbets!--With the greenery
  Of dewy branches and the flowery May,
    Sweet mediation betwixt earth and sky
  Providing, for the shepherd's holiday.
    Not upon gibbets! though the vulture leaves
  The bones to quiet, which he first picked bare.
    Not upon dungeons! though the wretch who grieves
  And groans within less stirs the outer air
    Than any little field-mouse stirs the sheaves.
  Not upon chain-bolts! though the slave's despair
    Has dulled his helpless miserable brain
  And left him blank beneath the freeman's whip
    To sing and laugh out idiocies of pain.
  Nor yet on starving homes! where many a lip
    Has sobbed itself asleep through curses vain.
  I love no peace which is not fellowship
    And which includes not mercy. I would have
  Rather the raking of the guns across
    The world, and shrieks against Heaven's architrave;
  Rather the struggle in the slippery fosse
    Of dying men and horses, and the wave
  Blood-bubbling.... Enough said!--by Christ's own cross,
    And by this faint heart of my womanhood,
  Such things are better than a Peace that sits
    Beside a hearth in self-commended mood,
  And takes no thought how wind and rain by fits
    Are howling out of doors against the good
  Of the poor wanderer. What! your peace admits
    Of outside anguish while it keeps at home?
  I loathe to take its name upon my tongue.
    'T is nowise peace: 't is treason, stiff with doom,--
  'T is gagged despair and inarticulate wrong,--
    Annihilated Poland, stifled Rome,
  Dazed Naples, Hungary fainting 'neath the thong,
    And Austria wearing a smooth olive-leaf
  On her brute forehead, while her hoofs outpress
    The life from these Italian souls, in brief.
  O Lord of Peace, who art Lord of Righteousness,
    Constrain the anguished worlds from sin and grief,
  Pierce them with conscience, purge them with redress,
    And give us peace which is no counterfeit!

  But wherefore should we look out any more
    From Casa Guidi windows? Shut them straight,
  And let us sit down by the folded door,
    And veil our saddened faces and, so, wait
  What next the judgment-heavens make ready for.
    I have grown too weary of these windows. Sights
  Come thick enough and clear enough in thought,
    Without the sunshine; souls have inner lights.
  And since the Grand-duke has come back and brought
    This army of the North which thus requites
  His filial South, we leave him to be taught.
    His South, too, has learnt something certainly,
  Whereof the practice will bring profit soon;
    And peradventure other eyes may see,
  From Casa Guidi windows, what is done
    Or undone. Whatsoever deeds they be,
  Pope Pius will be glorified in none.
    Record that gain, Mazzini!--it shall top
  Some heights of sorrow. Peter's rock, so named,
    Shall lure no vessel any more to drop
  Among the breakers. Peter's chair is shamed
    Like any vulgar throne the nations lop
  To pieces for their firewood unreclaimed,--
    And, when it burns too, we shall see as well
  In Italy as elsewhere. Let it burn.
    The cross, accounted still adorable,
  Is Christ's cross only!--if the thief's would earn
    Some stealthy genuflexions, we rebel;
  And here the impenitent thief's has had its turn,
    As God knows; and the people on their knees
  Scoff and toss back the crosiers stretched like yokes
    To press their heads down lower by degrees.
  So Italy, by means of these last strokes,
    Escapes the danger which preceded these,
  Of leaving captured hands in cloven oaks,--
    Of leaving very souls within the buckle
  Whence bodies struggled outward,--of supposing
    That freemen may like bondsmen kneel and truckle,
  And then stand up as usual, without losing
    An inch of stature.
                        Those whom she-wolves suckle
  Will bite as wolves do in the grapple-closing
    Of adverse interests. This at last is known
  (Thank Pius for the lesson), that albeit
    Among the popedom's hundred heads of stone
  Which blink down on you from the roof's retreat
    In Siena's tiger-striped cathedral, Joan
  And Borgia 'mid their fellows you may greet,
    A harlot and a devil,--you will see
  Not a man, still less angel, grandly set
    With open soul to render man more free.
  The fishers are still thinking of the net,
    And, if not thinking of the hook too, we
  Are counted somewhat deeply in their debt;
    But that's a rare case--so, by hook and crook
  They take the advantage, agonizing Christ
    By rustier nails than those of Cedron's brook,
  I' the people's body very cheaply priced,--
    And quote high priesthood out of Holy book,
  While buying death-fields with the sacrificed.

    Priests, priests,--there's no such name!--God's own, except
  Ye take most vainly. Through heaven's lifted gate
    The priestly ephod in sole glory swept
  When Christ ascended, entered in, and sate
    (With victor face sublimely overwept)
  At Deity's right hand, to mediate,
    He alone, He for ever. On His breast
  The Urim and the Thummim, fed with fire
    From the full Godhead, flicker with the unrest
  Of human pitiful heart-beats. Come up higher,
    All Christians! Levi's tribe is dispossest.
  That solitary alb ye shall admire,
    But not cast lots for. The last chrism, poured right,
  Was on that Head, and poured for burial
    And not for domination in men's sight.
  What are these churches? The old temple-wall
    Doth overlook them juggling with the sleight
  Of surplice, candlestick and altar-pall;
    East church and west church, ay, north church and south,
  Rome's church and England's,--let them all repent,
    And make concordats 'twixt their soul and mouth,
  Succeed Saint Paul by working at the tent,
    Become infallible guides by speaking truth,
  And excommunicate their pride that bent
    And cramped the souls of men.
                                  Why, even here
  Priestcraft burns out, the twinèd linen blazes;
    Not, like asbestos, to grow white and clear,
  But all to perish!--while the fire-smell raises
    To life some swooning spirits who, last year,
  Lost breath and heart in these church-stifled places.
    Why, almost, through this Pius, we believed
  The priesthood could be an honest thing, he smiled
    So saintly while our corn was being sheaved
  For his own granaries! Showing now defiled
    His hireling hands, a better help's achieved
  Than if they blessed us shepherd-like and mild.
    False doctrine, strangled by its own amen,
  Dies in the throat of all this nation. Who
    Will speak a pope's name as they rise again?
  What woman or what child will count him true?
    What dreamer praise him with the voice or pen?
  What man fight for him?--Pius takes his due.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Record that gain, Mazzini!--Yes, but first
  Set down thy people's faults; set down the want
    Of soul-conviction; set down aims dispersed,
  And incoherent means, and valour scant
    Because of scanty faith, and schisms accursed
  That wrench these brother-hearts from covenant
    With freedom and each other. Set down this,
  And this, and see to overcome it when
    The seasons bring the fruits thou wilt not miss
  If wary. Let no cry of patriot men
    Distract thee from the stern analysis
  Of masses who cry only! keep thy ken
    Clear as thy soul is virtuous. Heroes' blood
  Splashed up against thy noble brow in Rome;
    Let such not blind thee to an interlude
  Which was not also holy, yet did come
    'Twixt sacramental actions,--brotherhood
  Despised even there, and something of the doom
    Of Remus in the trenches. Listen now--
  Rossi died silent near where Cæsar died.
    HE did not say "My Brutus, is it thou?"
  But Italy unquestioned testified
    "I killed him! I am Brutus.--I avow."
  At which the whole world's laugh of scorn replied
    "A poor maimed copy of Brutus!"
                                    Too much like,
  Indeed, to be so unlike! too unskilled
    At Philippi and the honest battle-pike,
  To be so skilful where a man is killed
    Near Pompey's statue, and the daggers strike
  At unawares i' the throat. Was thus fulfilled
    An omen once of Michel Angelo?--
  When Marcus Brutus he conceived complete,
    And strove to hurl him out by blow on blow
  Upon the marble, at Art's thunderheat,
    Till haply (some pre-shadow rising slow
  Of what his Italy would fancy meet
    To be called BRUTUS) straight his plastic hand
  Fell back before his prophet-soul, and left
    A fragment, a maimed Brutus,--but more grand
  Than this, so named at Rome, was!
                                    Let thy weft
    Present one woof and warp, Mazzini! Stand
  With no man hankering for a dagger's heft,
    No, not for Italy!--nor stand apart,
  No, not for the Republic!--from those pure
    Brave men who hold the level of thy heart
  In patriot truth, as lover and as doer,
    Albeit they will not follow where thou art
  As extreme theorist. Trust and distrust fewer;
    And so bind strong and keep unstained the cause
  Which (God's sign granted) war-trumps newly blown
    Shall yet annunciate to the world's applause.

  But now, the world is busy; it has grown
    A Fair-going world. Imperial England draws
  The flowing ends of the earth from Fez, Canton,
    Delhi and Stockholm, Athens and Madrid,
  The Russias and the vast Americas,
    As if a queen drew in her robes amid
  Her golden cincture,--isles, peninsulas,
    Capes, continents, far inland countries hid
  By jasper-sands and hills of chrysopras,
    All trailing in their splendours through the door
  Of the gorgeous Crystal Palace. Every nation,
    To every other nation strange of yore,
  Gives face to face the civic salutation,
    And holds up in a proud right hand before
  That congress the best work which she can fashion
    By her best means. "These corals, will you please
  To match against your oaks? They grow as fast
    Within my wilderness of purple seas."--
  "This diamond stared upon me as I passed
    (As a live god's eye from a marble frieze)
  Along a dark of diamonds. Is it classed?"--
    "I wove these stuffs so subtly that the gold
  Swims to the surface of the silk like cream
    And curdles to fair patterns. Ye behold!"--
  "These delicatest muslins rather seem
    Than be, you think? Nay, touch them and be bold,
  Though such veiled Chakhi's face in Hafiz' dream."--
    "These carpets--you walk slow on them like kings,
  Inaudible like spirits, while your foot
    Dips deep in velvet roses and such things."--
  "Even Apollonius might commend this flute:[13]
    The music, winding through the stops, upsprings
  To make the player very rich: compute!"
    "Here's goblet-glass, to take in with your wine
  The very sun its grapes were ripened under:
    Drink light and juice together, and each fine."--
  "This model of a steamship moves your wonder?
    You should behold it crushing down the brine
  Like a blind Jove who feels his way with thunder."--
    "Here's sculpture! Ah, we live too! why not throw
  Our life into our marbles? Art has place
    For other artists after Angelo."--
  "I tried to paint out here a natural face;
    For nature includes Raffael, as we know,
  Not Raffael nature. Will it help my case?"--
    "Methinks you will not match this steel of ours!"--
  "Nor you this porcelain! One might dream the clay
    Retained in it the larvæ of the flowers,
  They bud so, round the cup, the old Spring-way."--
    "Nor you these carven woods, where birds in bowers
  With twisting snakes and climbing cupids, play."

    O Magi of the east and of the west,
  Your incense, gold and myrrh are excellent!--
    What gifts for Christ, then, bring ye with the rest?
  Your hands have worked well: is your courage spent
    In handwork only? Have you nothing best,
  Which generous souls may perfect and present,
    And He shall thank the givers for? no light
  Of teaching, liberal nations, for the poor
    Who sit in darkness when it is not night?
  No cure for wicked children? Christ,--no cure!
    No help for women sobbing out of sight
  Because men made the laws? no brothel-lure
    Burnt out by popular lightnings? Hast thou four
  No remedy, my England, for such woes?
    No outlet, Austria, for the scourged and bound,
  No entrance for the exiled? no repose,
    Russia, for knouted Poles worked underground,
  And gentle ladies bleached among the snows?
    No mercy for the slave, America?
  No hope for Rome, free France, chivalric France?
    Alas, great nations have great shames, I say.
  No pity, O world, no tender utterance
    Of benediction, and prayers stretched this way
  For poor Italia, baffled by mischance?
    O gracious nations, give some ear to me!
  You all go to your Fair, and I am one
    Who at the roadside of humanity
  Beseech your alms,--God's justice to be done.
    So, prosper!

                  In the name of Italy,
  Meantime, her patriot Dead have benison.
    They only have done well; and, what they did
  Being perfect, it shall triumph. Let them slumber:
    No king of Egypt in a pyramid
  Is safer from oblivion, though he number
    Full seventy cerements for a coverlid.
  These Dead be seeds of life, and shall encumber
    The sad heart of the land until it loose
  The clammy clods and let out the Spring-growth
    In beatific green through every bruise.
  The tyrant should take heed to what he doth,
    Since every victim-carrion turns to use,
  And drives a chariot, like a god made wroth,
    Against each piled injustice. Ay, the least,
  Dead for Italia, not in vain has died;
    Though many vainly, ere life's struggle ceased,
  To mad dissimilar ends have swerved aside;
    Each grave her nationality has pieced
  By its own majestic breadth, and fortified
    And pinned it deeper to the soil. Forlorn
  Of thanks be, therefore, no one of these graves!
    Not Hers,--who, at her husband's side, in scorn,
  Outfaced the whistling shot and hissing waves,
    Until she felt her little babe unborn
  Recoil, within her, from the violent staves
    And bloodhounds of the world,--at which, her life
  Dropt inwards from her eyes and followed it
    Beyond the hunters. Garibaldi's wife
  And child died so. And now, the seaweeds fit
    Her body, like a proper shroud and coif,
  And murmurously the ebbing waters grit
    The little pebbles while she lies interred
  In the sea-sand. Perhaps, ere dying thus,
    She looked up in his face (which never stirred
  From its clenched anguish) as to make excuse
    For leaving him for his, if so she erred.
  He well remembers that she could not choose.
    A memorable grave! Another is
  At Genoa. There, a king may fitly lie,
    Who, bursting that heroic heart of his
  At lost Novara, that he could not die
    (Though thrice into the cannon's eyes for this
  He plunged his shuddering steed, and felt the sky
    Reel back between the fire-shocks), stripped away
  The ancestral ermine ere the smoke had cleared,
    And, naked to the soul, that none might say
  His kingship covered what was base and bleared
    With treason, went out straight an exile, yea,
  An exiled patriot. Let him be revered.

    Yea, verily, Charles Albert has died well;
  And if he lived not all so, as one spoke,
    The sin pass softly with the passing-bell;
  For he was shriven, I think, in cannon-smoke,
    And, taking off his crown, made visible
  A hero's forehead. Shaking Austria's yoke
    He shattered his own hand and heart. "So best,"
  His last words were upon his lonely bed,
    I do not end like popes and dukes at least--
  "Thank God for it." And now that he is dead,
    Admitting it is proved and manifest
  That he was worthy, with a discrowned head,
    To measure heights with patriots, let them stand
  Beside the man in his Oporto shroud,
    And each vouchsafe to take him by the hand,
  And kiss him on the cheek, and say aloud,--
    "Thou, too, hast suffered for our native land!
  My brother, thou art one of us! be proud."

    Still, graves, when Italy is talked upon.
  Still, still, the patriot's tomb, the stranger's hate.
    Still Niobe! still fainting in the sun,
  By whose most dazzling arrows violate
    Her beauteous offspring perished! has she won
  Nothing but garlands for the graves, from Fate?
    Nothing but death-songs?--Yes, be it understood
  Life throbs in noble Piedmont! while the feet
    Of Rome's clay image, dabbled soft in blood,
  Grow flat with dissolution and, as meet,
    Will soon be shovelled off like other mud,
  To leave the passage free in church and street.
    And I, who first took hope up in this song,
  Because a child was singing one ... behold,
    The hope and omen were not, haply, wrong!
  Poets are soothsayers still, like those of old
    Who studied flights of doves; and creatures young
  And tender, mighty meanings may unfold.

    The sun strikes, through the windows, up the floor;
  Stand out in it, my own young Florentine,
    Not two years old, and let me see thee more!
  It grows along thy amber curls, to shine
    Brighter than elsewhere. Now, look straight before,
  And fix thy brave blue English eyes on mine,
    And from my soul, which fronts the future so,
  With unabashed and unabated gaze,
    Teach me to hope for, what the angels know
  When they smile clear as thou dost. Down God's ways
    With just alighted feet, between the snow
  And snowdrops, where a little lamb may graze,
    Thou hast no fear, my lamb, about the road,
  Albeit in our vain-glory we assume
    That, less than we have, thou hast learnt of God.
  Stand out, my blue-eyed prophet!--thou, to whom
    The earliest world-day light that ever flowed,
  Through Casa Guidi Windows chanced to come!
    Now shake the glittering nimbus of thy hair,
  And be God's witness that the elemental
    New springs of life are gushing everywhere
  To cleanse the watercourses, and prevent all
    Concrete obstructions which infest the air!
  That earth's alive, and gentle or ungentle
    Motions within her, signify but growth!--
  The ground swells greenest o'er the labouring moles.

    Howe'er the uneasy world is vexed and wroth,
  Young children, lifted high on parent souls,
    Look round them with a smile upon the mouth,
  And take for music every bell that tolls;
    (WHO said we should be better if like these?)
  But we sit murmuring for the future though
    Posterity is smiling on our knees,
  Convicting us of folly. Let us go--
    We will trust God. The blank interstices
  Men take for ruins, He will build into
    With pillared marbles rare, or knit across
  With generous arches, till the fane's complete.
    This world has no perdition, if some loss.

  Such cheer I gather from thy smiling, Sweet!
    The self-same cherub-faces which emboss
  The Vail, lean inward to the Mercy-seat.


NAPOLEON III. IN ITALY.


  I.

  Emperor, Emperor!
  From the centre to the shore,
    From the Seine back to the Rhine,
  Stood eight millions up and swore
    By their manhood's right divine
  So to elect and legislate,
    This man should renew the line
  Broken in a strain of fate
  And leagued kings at Waterloo,
  When the people's hands let go.
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  II.

  With a universal shout
  They took the old regalia out
  From an open grave that day;
    From a grave that would not close,
  Where the first Napoleon lay
    Expectant, in repose,
  As still as Merlin, with his conquering face
    Turned up in its unquenchable appeal
  To men and heroes of the advancing race,--
    Prepared to set the seal
  Of what has been on what shall be.
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  III.

  The thinkers stood aside
    To let the nation act.
    Some hated the new-constituted fact
  Of empire, as pride treading on their pride.
  Some quailed, lest what was poisonous in the past
    Should graft itself in that Druidic bough
      On this green Now.
  Some cursed, because at last
  The open heavens to which they had looked in vain
  For many a golden fall of marvellous rain
  Were closed in brass; and some
  Wept on because a gone thing could not come;
  And some were silent, doubting all things for
  That popular conviction,--evermore
          Emperor.

  IV.

  That day I did not hate
    Nor doubt, nor quail nor curse.
  I, reverencing the people, did not bate
  My reverence of their deed and oracle,
  Nor vainly prate
    Of better and of worse
  Against the great conclusion of their will.
    And yet, O voice and verse,
  Which God set in me to acclaim and sing
  Conviction, exaltation, aspiration,
  We gave no music to the patent thing,
    Nor spared a holy rhythm to throb and swim
    About the name of him
  Translated to the sphere of domination
    By democratic passion!
  I was not used, at least,
    Nor can be, now or then,
  To stroke the ermine beast
    On any kind of throne
    (Though builded by a nation for its own),
  And swell the surging choir for kings of men--
          "Emperor
          Evermore."

  V.

    But now, Napoleon, now
  That, leaving far behind the purple throng
    Of vulgar monarchs, thou
    Tread'st higher in thy deed
    Than stair of throne can lead,
    To help in the hour of wrong
    The broken hearts of nations to be strong,--
    Now, lifted as thou art
    To the level of pure song,
  We stand to meet thee on these Alpine snows!
    And while the palpitating peaks break out
  Ecstatic from somnambular repose
    With answers to the presence and the shout,
  We, poets of the people, who take part
    With elemental justice, natural right,
  Join in our echoes also, nor refrain.
    We meet thee, O Napoleon, at this height
  At last, and find thee great enough to praise.
  Receive the poet's chrism, which smells beyond
    The priest's, and pass thy ways;--
  An English poet warns thee to maintain
  God's word, not England's:--let His truth be true
  And all men liars! with His truth respond
  To all men's lie. Exalt the sword and smite
  On that long anvil of the Apennine
  Where Austria forged the Italian chain in view
  Of seven consenting nations, sparks of fine Admonitory light,
  Till men's eyes wink before convictions new.
  Flash in God's justice to the world's amaze,
  Sublime Deliverer!--after many days
  Found worthy of the deed thou art come to do--
          Emperor.
          Evermore.

  VI.

    But Italy, my Italy,
      Can it last, this gleam?
    Can she live and be strong,
      Or is it another dream
  Like the rest we have dreamed so long?
    And shall it, must it be,
  That after the battle-cloud has broken
      She will die off again
      Like the rain,
    Or like a poet's song
      Sung of her, sad at the end
    Because her name is Italy,--
      Die and count no friend?
  Is it true,--may it be spoken,--
    That she who has lain so still,
  With a wound in her breast,
  And a flower in her hand,
  And a grave-stone under her head,
    While every nation at will
  Beside her has dared to stand,
  And flout her with pity and scorn,
    Saying "She is at rest,
  She is fair, she is dead,
  And, leaving room in her stead
  To Us who are later born,
    This is certainly best!"
  Saying "Alas, she is fair,
  Very fair, but dead,--give place,
  And so we have room for the race."
  --Can it be true, be true,
  That she lives anew?
  That she rises up at the shout of her sons,
    At the trumpet of France,
  And lives anew?--is it true
    That she has not moved in a trance,
  As in Forty-eight?
    When her eyes were troubled with blood
  Till she knew not friend from foe,
  Till her hand was caught in a strait
  Of her cerement and baffled so
    From doing the deed she would;
  And her weak foot stumbled across
  The grave of a king,
  And down she dropt at heavy loss,
    And we gloomily covered her face and said,
  "We have dreamed the thing;
    She is not alive, but dead."

  VII.

  Now, shall we say
    Our Italy lives indeed?
  And if it were not for the beat and bray
  Of drum and trump of martial men,
  Should we feel the underground heave and strain,
    Where heroes left their dust as a seed
  Sure to emerge one day?
  And if it were not for the rhythmic march
    Of France and Piedmont's double hosts,
    Should we hear the ghosts
  Thrill through ruined aisle and arch,
    Throb along the frescoed wall,
  Whisper an oath by that divine
  They left in picture, book, and stone,
    That Italy is not dead at all?
  Ay, if it were not for the tears in our eyes,
  These tears of a sudden passionate joy,
    Should we see her arise
  From the place where the wicked are overthrown,
  Italy, Italy--loosed at length
    From the tyrant's thrall,
  Pale and calm in her strength?
  Pale as the silver cross of Savoy
  When the hand that bears the flag is brave,
  And not a breath is stirring, save
    What is blown
  Over the war-trump's lip of brass,
  Ere Garibaldi forces the pass!

  VIII.

    Ay, it is so, even so.
    Ay, and it shall be so.
  Each broken stone that long ago
  She flung behind her as she went
  In discouragement and bewilderment
  Through the cairns of Time, and missed her way
  Between to-day and yesterday,
    Up springs a living man.
  And each man stands with his face in the light
    Of his own drawn sword,
  Ready to do what a hero can.
    Wall to sap, or river to ford,
  Cannon to front, or foe to pursue,
  Still ready to do, and sworn to be true,
    As a man and a patriot can.
    Piedmontese, Neapolitan,
  Lombard, Tuscan, Romagnole,
  Each man's body having a soul,--
  Count how many they stand,
  All of them sons of the land,
    Every live man there
  Allied to a dead man below,
    And the deadest with blood to spare
  To quicken a living hand
  In case it should ever be slow.
  Count how many they come
  To the beat of Piedmont's drum,
    With faces keener and grayer
    Than swords of the Austrian slayer,
  All set against the foe.
          "Emperor
          Evermore."

  IX.

  Out of the dust where they ground them;
    Out of the holes where they dogged them;
  Out of the hulks where they wound them
    In iron, tortured and flogged them;
  Out of the streets where they chased them,
    Taxed them, and then bayonetted them;
  Out of the homes where they spied on them
    (Using their daughters and wives);
    Out of the church where they fretted them,
  Rotted their souls and debased them,
    Trained them to answer with knives,
  Then cursed them all at their prayers!--
  Out of cold lands, not theirs,
  Where they exiled them, starved them, lied on them;
  Back they come like a wind, in vain
    Cramped up in the hills, that roars its road
  The stronger into the open plain,
  Or like a fire that burns the hotter
    And longer for the crust of cinder,
  Serving better the ends of the potter;
    Or like a restrainèd word of God,
    Fulfilling itself by what seems to hinder.
          "Emperor
          Evermore."

  X.

  Shout for France and Savoy!
    Shout for the helper and doer.
  Shout for the good sword's ring,
    Shout for the thought still truer.
  Shout for the spirits at large
  Who passed for the dead this spring,
    Whose living glory is sure.
  Shout for France and Savoy!
  Shout for the council and charge!
    Shout for the head of Cavour;
  And shout for the heart of a King
  That's great with a nation's joy!
    Shout for France and Savoy!

  XI.

  Take up the child, Macmahon, though
    Thy hand be red
    From Magenta's dead,
  And riding on, in front of the troop,
    In the dust of the whirlwind of war
  Through the gate of the city of Milan, stoop
  And take up the child to thy saddle-bow,
  Nor fear the touch as soft as a flower of his smile as clear as a
        star!
  Thou hast a right to the child, we say,
  Since the women are weeping for joy as they
  Who, by thy help and from this day,
    Shall be happy mothers indeed.
  They are raining flowers from terrace and roof:
    Take up the flower in the child.
  While the shout goes up of a nation freed
    And heroically self-reconciled,
  Till the snow on that peaked Alp aloof
  Starts, as feeling God's finger anew,
  And all those cold white marble fires
  Of mounting saints on the Duomo-spires
    Flicker against the Blue.
          "Emperor
          Evermore."

  XII.

      Ay, it is He,
  Who rides at the King's right hand!
  Leave room to his horse and draw to the side,
    Nor press too near in the ecstasy
  Of a newly delivered impassioned land:
    He is moved, you see,
  He who has done it all.
  They call it a cold stern face;
    But this is Italy
  Who rises up to her place!--
  For this he fought in his youth,
  Of this he dreamed in the past;
    The lines of the resolute mouth
    Tremble a little at last.
    Cry, he has done it all!
          "Emperor
          Evermore."

  XIII.

  It is not strange that he did it,
    Though the deed may seem to strain
  To the wonderful, unpermitted,
    For such as lead and reign.
  But he is strange, this man:
    The people's instinct found him
  (A wind in the dark that ran
  Through a chink where was no door),
    And elected him and crowned him
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  XIV.

  Autocrat? let them scoff,
    Who fail to comprehend
  That a ruler incarnate of
    The people must transcend
  All common king-born kings;
  These subterranean springs
  A sudden outlet winning
    Have special virtues to spend.
  The people's blood runs through him,
    Dilates from head to foot,
    Creates him absolute,
  And from this great beginning
    Evokes a greater end
  To justify and renew him--
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  XV.

  What! did any maintain
  That God or the people (think!)
  Could make a marvel in vain?--
    Out of the water-jar there,
  Draw wine that none could drink?
  Is this a man like the rest,
    This miracle, made unaware
    By a rapture of popular air,
  And caught to the place that was best?
  You think he could barter and cheat
    As vulgar diplomates use,
  With the people's heart in his breast?
  Prate a lie into shape
  Lest truth should cumber the road;
    Play at the fast and loose
  Till the world is strangled with tape;
  Maim the soul's complete
    To fit the hole of a toad;
  And filch the dogman's meat
    To feed the offspring of God?

  XVI.

  Nay, but he, this wonder,
    He cannot palter nor prate,
  Though many around him and under,
  With intellects trained to the curve,
  Distrust him in spirit and nerve
    Because his meaning is straight.
  Measure him ere he depart
    With those who have governed and led;
  Larger so much by the heart,
    Larger so much by the head.
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  XVII.

  He holds that, consenting or dissident,
    Nations must move with the time;
  Assumes that crime with a precedent
    Doubles the guilt of the crime;
  --Denies that a slaver's bond,
    Or a treaty signed by knaves
  (Quorum magna pars, and beyond
  Was one of an honest name),
  Gives an inexpugnable claim
    To abolish men into slaves.
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  XVIII.

  He will not swagger nor boast
    Of his country's meeds, in a tone
  Missuiting a great man most
    If such should speak of his own;
  Nor will he act, on her side,
    From motives baser, indeed,
  Than a man of a noble pride
    Can avow for himself at need;
  Never, for lucre or laurels,
    Or custom, though such should be rife,
  Adapting the smaller morals
    To measure the larger life.
  He, though the merchants persuade,
    And the soldiers are eager for strife,
  Finds not his country in quarrels
    Only to find her in trade,--
  While still he accords her such honour
    As never to flinch for her sake
  Where men put service upon her,
    Found heavy to undertake
  And scarcely like to be paid:
  Believing a nation may act
    Unselfishly--shiver a lance
  (As the least of her sons may, in fact)
    And not for a cause of finance.
          Emperor
          Evermore.

  XIX.

    Great is he
  Who uses his greatness for all.
  His name shall stand perpetually
    As a name to applaud and cherish,
  Not only within the civic wall
  For the loyal, but also without
    For the generous and free.
    Just is he,
  Who is just for the popular due
    As well as the private debt.
  The praise of nations ready to perish
  Fall on him,--crown him in view
    Of tyrants caught in the net,
  And statesmen dizzy with fear and doubt!
  And though, because they are many,
    And he is merely one,
  And nations selfish and cruel
  Heap up the inquisitor's fuel
    To kill the body of high intents,
  And burn great deeds from their place,
  Till this, the greatest of any,
    May seem imperfectly done;
    Courage, whoever circumvents!
  Courage, courage, whoever is base!
  The soul of a high intent, be it known,
  Can die no more than any soul
  Which God keeps by Him under the throne;
  And this, at whatever interim,
    Shall live, and be consummated
  Into the being of deeds made whole.
  Courage, courage! happy is he,
    Of whom (himself among the dead
    And silent) this word shall be said:
  --That he might have had the world with him,
    But chose to side with suffering men,
    And had the world against him when
  He came to deliver Italy.
          Emperor
          Evermore.




THE DANCE.


  I.

  You remember down at Florence our Cascine,
    Where the people on the feast-days walk and drive,
  And, through the trees, long-drawn in many a green way,
    O'er-roofing hum and murmur like a hive,
    The river and the mountains look alive?

  II.

  You remember the piazzone there, the stand-place
    Of carriages a-brim with Florence Beauties,
  Who lean and melt to music as the band plays,
    Or smile and chat with someone who a-foot is,
    Or on horseback, in observance of male duties?

  III.

  'T is so pretty, in the afternoons of summer,
    So many gracious faces brought together!
  Call it rout, or call it concert, they have come here,
    In the floating of the fan and of the feather,
    To reciprocate with beauty the fine weather.

  IV.

  While the flower-girls offer nosegays (because they too
    Go with other sweets) at every carriage-door;
  Here, by shake of a white finger, signed away to
    Some next buyer, who sits buying score on score,
    Piling roses upon roses evermore.

  V.

  And last season, when the French camp had its station
    In the meadow-ground, things quickened and grew gayer
  Through the mingling of the liberating nation
    With this people; groups of Frenchmen everywhere,
    Strolling, gazing, judging lightly--"who was fair."

  VI.

  Then the noblest lady present took upon her
    To speak nobly from her carriage for the rest:
  "Pray these officers from France to do us honour
    By dancing with us straightway." The request
    Was gravely apprehended as addressed.

  VII.

  And the men of France, bareheaded, bowing lowly,
    Led out each a proud signora to the space
  Which the startled crowd had rounded for them--slowly,
    Just a touch of still emotion in his face,
    Not presuming, through the symbol, on the grace.

  VIII.

  There was silence in the people: some lips trembled,
    But none jested. Broke the music, at a glance:
  And the daughters of our princes, thus assembled,
    Stepped the measure with the gallant sons of France,
    Hush! it might have been a Mass, and not a dance.


  IX.

  And they danced there till the blue that overskied us
    Swooned with passion, though the footing seemed sedate;
  And the mountains, heaving mighty hearts beside us,
    Sighed a rapture in a shadow, to dilate,
    And touch the holy stone where Dante sate.

  X.

  Then the sons of France, bareheaded, lowly bowing,
    Led the ladies back where kinsmen of the south
  Stood, received them; till, with burst of overflowing
    Feeling--husbands, brothers, Florence's male youth,
    Turned, and kissed the martial strangers mouth to mouth.

  XI.

  And a cry went up, a cry from all that people!
    --You have heard a people cheering, you suppose,
  For the Member, mayor ... with chorus from the steeple?
    This was different: scarce as loud, perhaps (who knows?),
    For we saw wet eyes around us ere the close.

  XII.

  And we felt as if a nation, too long borne in
    By hard wrongers,--comprehending in such attitude
  That God had spoken somewhere since the morning,
    That men were somehow brothers, by no platitude,--
    Cried exultant in great wonder and free gratitude.




A TALE OF VILLAFRANCA.

TOLD IN TUSCANY.


  I.

  My little son, my Florentine,
    Sit down beside my knee,
  And I will tell you why the sign
    Of joy which flushed our Italy
  Has faded since but yesternight;
  And why your Florence of delight
    Is mourning as you see.

  II.

  A great man (who was crowned one day)
    Imagined a great Deed:
  He shaped it out of cloud and clay,
    He touched it finely till the seed
  Possessed the flower: from heart and brain
  He fed it with large thoughts humane,
    To help a people's need.

  III.

  He brought it out into the sun--
    They blessed it to his face:
  "O great pure Deed, that hast undone
    So many bad and base!
  O generous Deed, heroic Deed,
  Come forth, be perfected, succeed,
    Deliver by God's grace."

  IV.

  Then sovereigns, statesmen, north and south,
    Rose up in wrath and fear,
  And cried, protesting by one mouth,
    "What monster have we here?
  A great Deed at this hour of day?
  A great just Deed--and not for pay?
    Absurd,--or insincere."

  V.

  "And if sincere, the heavier blow
    In that case we shall bear,
  For where's our blessed 'status quo,'
    Our holy treaties, where,--
  Our rights to sell a race, or buy,
  Protect and pillage, occupy,
    And civilize despair?"

  VI.

  Some muttered that the great Deed meant
    A great pretext to sin;
  And others, the pretext, so lent,
    Was heinous (to begin).
  Volcanic terms of "great" and "just"?
  Admit such tongues of flame, the crust
    Of time and law falls in.

  VII.

  A great Deed in this world of ours?
    Unheard of the pretence is:
  It threatens plainly the great Powers;
    Is fatal in all senses.
  A just Deed in the world?--call out
  The rifles! be not slack about
    The national defences.

  VIII.

  And many murmured, "From this source
    What red blood must be poured!"
  And some rejoined, "'T is even worse;
    What red tape is ignored!"
  All cursed the Doer for an evil
  Called here, enlarging on the Devil,--
    There, monkeying the Lord!

  IX.

  Some said it could not be explained,
    Some, could not be excused;
  And others, "Leave it unrestrained,
    Gehenna's self is loosed."
  And all cried "Crush it, maim it, gag it!
  Set dog-toothed lies to tear it ragged,
    Truncated and traduced!"

  X.

  But HE stood sad before the sun
    (The peoples felt their fate).
  "The world is many,--I am one;
    My great Deed was too great.
  God's fruit of justice ripens slow:
  Men's souls are narrow; let them grow.
    My brothers, we must wait."

  XI.

  The tale is ended, child of mine,
    Turned graver at my knee.
  They say your eyes, my Florentine,
    Are English: it may be.
  And yet I've marked as blue a pair
  Following the doves across the square
    At Venice by the sea.

  XII.

  Ah child! ah child! I cannot say
    A word more. You conceive
  The reason now, why just to-day
    We see our Florence grieve.
  Ah child, look up into the sky!
  In this low world, where great Deeds die,
    What matter if we live?




A COURT LADY.


  I.

  Her hair was tawny with gold, her eyes with purple were dark,
  Her cheeks' pale opal burnt with a red and restless spark.

  II.

  Never was lady of Milan nobler in name and in race;
  Never was lady of Italy fairer to see in the face.

  III.

  Never was lady on earth more true as woman and wife,
  Larger in judgment and instinct, prouder in manners and life.

  IV.

  She stood in the early morning, and said to her maidens "Bring
  That silken robe made ready to wear at the Court of the King.

  V.

  "Bring me the clasps of diamond, lucid, clear of the mote,
  Clasp me the large at the waist, and clasp me the small at the
        throat.

  VI.

  "Diamonds to fasten the hair, and diamonds to fasten the sleeves,
  Laces to drop from their rays, like a powder of snow from the
        eaves."

  VII.

  Gorgeous she entered the sunlight which gathered her up in a flame,
  While, straight in her open carriage, she to the hospital came.

  VIII.

  In she went at the door, and gazing from end to end,
  "Many and low are the pallets, but each is the place of a friend."

  IX.

  Up she passed through the wards, and stood at a young man's bed:
  Bloody the band on his brow, and livid the droop of his head.

  X.

  "Art thou a Lombard, my brother? Happy art thou," she cried,
  And smiled like Italy on him: he dreamed in her face and died.

  XI.

  Pale with his passing soul, she went on still to a second:
  He was a grave hard man, whose years by dungeons were reckoned.

  XII.

  Wounds in his body were sore, wounds in his life were sorer.
  "Art thou a Romagnole?" Her eyes drove lightnings before her.

  XIII.

  "Austrian and priest had joined to double and tighten the cord
  Able to bind thee, O strong one,--free by the stroke of a sword.

  XIV.

  "Now be grave for the rest of us, using the life overcast
  To ripen our wine of the present (too new) in glooms of the past."

  XV.

  Down she stepped to a pallet where lay a face like a girl's,
  Young, and pathetic with dying,--a deep black hole in the curls.

  XVI.

  "Art thou from Tuscany, brother? and seest thou, dreaming in pain,
  Thy mother stand in the piazza, searching the List of the slain?"

  XVII.

  Kind as a mother herself, she touched his cheeks with her hands:
  "Blessed is she who has borne thee, although she should weep as she
        stands."

  XVIII.

  On she passed to a Frenchman, his arm carried off by a ball:
  Kneeling,--"O more than my brother! how shall I thank thee for all?

  XIX.

  "Each of the heroes around us has fought for his land and line,
  But thou hast fought for a stranger, in hate of a wrong not thine.

  XX.

  "Happy are all free peoples, too strong to be dispossessed.
  But blessed are those among nations who dare to be strong for the
        rest!"

  XXI.

  Ever she passed on her way, and came to a couch where pined
  One with a face from Venetia, white with a hope out of mind.

  XXII.

  Long she stood and gazed, and twice she tried at the name,
  But two great crystal tears were all that faltered and came.

  XXIII.

  Only a tear for Venice?--she turned as in passion and loss,
  And stooped to his forehead and kissed it, as if she were kissing
        the cross.

  XXIV.

  Faint with that strain of heart she moved on then to another,
  Stern and strong in his death. "And dost thou suffer, my brother?"

  XXV.

  Holding his hands in hers:--"Out of the Piedmont lion
  Cometh the sweetness of freedom! sweetest to live or to die on."

  XXVI.

  Holding his cold rough hands,--"Well, oh well have ye done
  In noble, noble Piedmont, who would not be noble alone."

  XXVII.

  Back he fell while she spoke. She rose to her feet with a spring,--
  "That was a Piedmontese! and this is the Court of the King."




AN AUGUST VOICE.

"Una voce augusta."--Monitore Toscano.


  I.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    I made the treaty upon it.
  Just venture a quiet rebuke;
    Dall' Ongaro write him a sonnet;
  Ricasoli gently explain
    Some need of the constitution:
  He'll swear to it over again,
    Providing an "easy solution."
  You'll call back the Grand-duke.

  II.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    I promised the Emperor Francis
  To argue the case by his book,
    And ask you to meet his advances.
  The Ducal cause, we know
    (Whether you or he be the wronger),
  Has very strong points;--although
    Your bayonets, there, have stronger.
  You'll call back the Grand-duke.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    He is not pure altogether.
  For instance, the oath which he took
    (In the Forty-eight rough weather)
  He'd "nail your flag to his mast,"
    Then softly scuttled the boat you
  Hoped to escape in at last,
    And both by a "Proprio motu."
  You'll call back the Grand-duke.

  IV.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    The scheme meets nothing to shock it
  In this smart letter, look,
    We found in Radetsky's pocket;
  Where his Highness in sprightly style
    Of the flower of his Tuscans wrote,
  "These heads be the hottest in file;
    Pray shoot them the quickest." Quote,
  And call back the Grand-duke.

  V.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    There are some things to object to.
  He cheated, betrayed, and forsook,
    Then called in the foe to protect you.
  He taxed you for wines and for meats
    Throughout that eight years' pastime
  Of Austria's drum in your streets--
    Of course you remember the last time
  You called back your Grand-duke?

  VI.

  You'll take back the Grand-duke?
    It is not race he is poor in,
  Although he never could brook
    The patriot cousin at Turin.
  His love of kin you discern,
    By his hate of your flag and me--
  So decidedly apt to turn
    All colours at the sight of the Three.[14]
  You'll call back the Grand-duke.

  VII.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    'T was weak that he fled from the Pitti;
  But consider how little he shook
    At thought of bombarding your city!
  And, balancing that with this,
    The Christian rule is plain for us;
  ... Or the Holy Father's Swiss
    Have shot his Perugians in vain for us.
  You'll call back the Grand-duke.

  VIII.

  Pray take back your Grand-duke.
    --I, too, have suffered persuasion.
  All Europe, raven and rook,
    Screeched at me armed for your nation.
  Your cause in my heart struck spurs;
    I swept such warnings aside for you:
  My very child's eyes, and Hers,
    Grew like my brother's who died for you.
  You'll call back the Grand-duke?

  IX.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    My French fought nobly with reason,--
  Left many a Lombardy nook
    Red as with wine out of season.
  Little we grudged what was done there,
    Paid freely your ransom of blood:
  Our heroes stark in the sun there
    We would not recall if we could.
  You'll call back the Grand-duke?

  X.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    His son rode fast as he got off
  That day on the enemy's hook,
    When I had an epaulette shot off.
  Though splashed (as I saw him afar--no
    Near) by those ghastly rains,
  The mark, when you've washed him in Arno,
    Will scarcely be larger than Cain's.
  You'll call back the Grand-duke?

  XI.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    'T will be so simple, quite beautiful:
  The shepherd recovers his crook,
    ... If you should be sheep, and dutiful.
  I spoke a word worth chalking
    On Milan's wall--but stay,
  Here's Poniatowsky talking,--
    You'll listen to him to-day,
  And call back the Grand-duke.

  XII.

  You'll take back your Grand-duke?
    Observe, there's no one to force it,--
  Unless the Madonna, Saint Luke
    Drew for you, choose to endorse it.
  I charge you, by great Saint Martino
    And prodigies quickened by wrong,
  Remember your Dead on Ticino;
    Be worthy, be constant, be strong--
  Bah!--call back the Grand-duke!!


CHRISTMAS GIFTS.

  ~hôs basilei, hôs theps, hôs nekrps.~
  GREGORY NAZIANZEN.


  I.

  The Pope on Christmas Day
    Sits in Saint Peter's chair;
  But the peoples murmur and say
    "Our souls are sick and forlorn,
  And who will show us where
    Is the stable where Christ was born?"

  II.

  The star is lost in the dark;
    The manger is lost in the straw;
  The Christ cries faintly ... hark!...
    Through bands that swaddle and strangle--
  But the Pope in the chair of awe
    Looks down the great quadrangle.

  III.

  The Magi kneel at his foot,
    Kings of the East and West,
  But, instead of the angels (mute
    Is the "Peace on earth" of their song),
  The peoples, perplexed and opprest,
    Are sighing "How long, how long?"

  IV.

  And, instead of the kine, bewilder in
    Shadow of aisle and dome,
  The bear who tore up the children,
    The fox who burnt up the corn,
  And the wolf who suckled at Rome
    Brothers to slay and to scorn.

  V.

  Cardinals left and right of him,
    Worshippers round and beneath,
  The silver trumpets at sight of him
    Thrill with a musical blast:
  But the people say through their teeth,
    "Trumpets? we wait for the Last!"

  VI.

  He sits in the place of the Lord,
    And asks for the gifts of the time;
  Gold, for the haft of a sword
    To win back Romagna averse,
  Incense, to sweeten a crime,
    And myrrh, to embitter a curse.

  VII.

  Then a king of the West said "Good!--
    I bring thee the gifts of the time;
  Red, for the patriot's blood,
    Green, for the martyr's crown,
  White, for the dew and the rime,
    When the morning of God comes down."

  VIII.

  --O mystic tricolor bright!
    The Pope's heart quailed like a man's;
  The cardinals froze at the sight,
    Bowing their tonsures hoary:
  And the eyes in the peacock-fans
    Winked at the alien glory.

  IX.

  But the peoples exclaimed in hope,
    "Now blessed be he who has brought
  These gifts of the time to the Pope,
    When our souls were sick and forlorn.
  --And here is the star we sought,
    To show us where Christ was born!"




ITALY AND THE WORLD.


  I.

  Florence, Bologna, Parma, Modena:
    When you named them a year ago,
  So many graves reserved by God, in a
    Day of Judgment, you seemed to know,
  To open and let out the resurrection.

  II.

  And meantime (you made your reflection
    If you were English), was nought to be done
  But sorting sables, in predilection
    For all those martyrs dead and gone,
  Till the new earth and heaven made ready.

  III.

  And if your politics were not heady,
    Violent, ... "Good," you added, "good
  In all things! Mourn on sure and steady.
    Churchyard thistles are wholesome food
  For our European wandering asses.

  IV.

  "The date of the resurrection passes
    Human foreknowledge: men unborn
  Will gain by it (even in the lower classes),
    But none of these. It is not the morn
  Because the cock of France is crowing.

  V.

  "Cocks crow at midnight, seldom knowing
    Starlight from dawn-light! 't is a mad
  Poor creature." Here you paused, and growing
    Scornful,--suddenly, let us add,
  The trumpet sounded, the graves were open.

  VI.

  Life and life and life! agrope in
    The dusk of death, warm hands, stretched out
  For swords, proved more life still to hope in,
    Beyond and behind. Arise with a shout,
  Nation of Italy, slain and buried!

  VII.

  Hill to hill and turret to turret
    Flashing the tricolor,--newly created
  Beautiful Italy, calm, unhurried,
    Rise heroic and renovated,
  Rise to the final restitution.

  VIII.

  Rise; prefigure the grand solution
    Of earth's municipal, insular schisms,--
  Statesmen draping self-love's conclusion
    In cheap vernacular patriotisms,
  Unable to give up Judæa for Jesus.

  IX.

  Bring us the higher example; release us
    Into the larger coming time:
  And into Christ's broad garment piece us
    Rags of virtue as poor as crime,
  National selfishness, civic vaunting.

  X.

  No more Jew nor Greek then,--taunting
    Nor taunted;--no more England nor France!
  But one confederate brotherhood planting
    One flag only, to mark the advance,
  Onward and upward, of all humanity.

  XI.

  For civilization perfected
    Is fully developed Christianity.
  "Measure the frontier," shall it be said,
    "Count the ships," in national vanity?
  --Count the nation's heart-beats sooner.

  XII.

  For, though behind by a cannon or schooner,
    That nation still is predominant
  Whose pulse beats quickest in zeal to oppugn or
    Succour another, in wrong or want,
  Passing the frontier in love and abhorrence.

  XIII.

  Modena, Parma, Bologna, Florence,
    Open us out the wider way!
  Dwarf in that chapel of old Saint Lawrence
    Your Michel Angelo's giant Day,
  With the grandeur of this Day breaking o'er us!

  XIV.

  Ye who, restrained as an ancient chorus,
    Mute while the coryphæus spake,
  Hush your separate voices before us,
    Sink your separate lives for the sake
  Of one sole Italy's living for ever!

  XV.

  Givers of coat and cloak too,--never
    Grudging that purple of yours at the best,
  By your heroic will and endeavour
    Each sublimely dispossessed,
  That all may inherit what each surrenders!

  XVI.

  Earth shall bless you, O noble emenders
    On egotist nations! Ye shall lead
  The plough of the world, and sow new splendours
    Into the furrow of things for seed,--
  Ever the richer for what ye have given.

  XVII.

  Lead us and teach us, till earth and heaven
    Grow larger around us and higher above.
  Our sacrament-bread has a bitter leaven;
    We bait our traps with the name of love,
  Till hate itself has a kinder meaning.

  XVIII.

  Oh, this world: this cheating and screening
    Of cheats! this conscience for candle-wicks,
  Not beacon-fires! this overweening
    Of underhand diplomatical tricks,
  Dared for the country while scorned for the counter!

  XIX.

  Oh, this envy of those who mount here,
    And oh, this malice to make them trip!
  Rather quenching the fire there, drying the fount here,
    To frozen body and thirsty lip,
  Than leave to a neighbour their ministration.

  XX.

  I cry aloud in my poet-passion,
    Viewing my England o'er Alp and sea.
  I loved her more in her ancient fashion:
    She carries her rifles too thick for me
  Who spares them so in the cause of a brother.

  XXI.

  Suspicion, panic? end this pother.
    The sword, kept sheathless at peace-time, rusts.
  None fears for himself while he feels for another:
    The brave man either fights or trusts,
  And wears no mail in his private chamber.

  XXII.

  Beautiful Italy! golden amber
    Warm with the kisses of lover and traitor!
  Thou who hast drawn us on to remember,
    Draw us to hope now: let us be greater
  By this new future than that old story.

  XXIII.

  Till truer glory replaces all glory,
    As the torch grows blind at the dawn of day;
  And the nations, rising up, their sorry
    And foolish sins shall put away,
  As children their toys when the teacher enters.

  XXIV.

  Till Love's one centre devour these centres
    Of many self-loves; and the patriot's trick
  To better his land by egotist ventures,
    Defamed from a virtue, shall make men sick,
  As the scalp at the belt of some red hero.

  XXV.

  For certain virtues have dropped to zero,
    Left by the sun on the mountain's dewy side;
  Churchman's charities, tender as Nero,
    Indian suttee, heathen suicide,
  Service to rights divine, proved hollow:

  XXVI.

  And Heptarchy patriotisms must follow.
    --National voices, distinct yet dependent,
  Ensphering each other, as swallow does swallow,
    With circles still widening and ever ascendant,
  In multiform life to united progression,--

  XXVII.

  These shall remain. And when, in the session
    Of nations, the separate language is heard,
  Each shall aspire, in sublime indiscretion,
    To help with a thought or exalt with a word
  Less her own than her rival's honour.

  XXVIII.

  Each Christian nation shall take upon her
    The law of the Christian man in vast:
  The crown of the getter shall fall to the donor,
    And last shall be first while first shall be last,
  And to love best shall still be, to reign unsurpassed.




A CURSE FOR A NATION.

PROLOGUE.


  I heard an angel speak last night,
        And he said "Write!
  Write a Nation's curse for me,
  And send it over the Western Sea."

  I faltered, taking up the word:
        "Not so, my lord!
  If curses must be, choose another
  To send thy curse against my brother.

  "For I am bound by gratitude,
        By love and blood,
  To brothers of mine across the sea,
  Who stretch out kindly hands to me."

  "Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
        My curse to-night.
  From the summits of love a curse is driven,
  As lightning is from the tops of heaven."

  "Not so," I answered. "Evermore
        My heart is sore
  For my own land's sins: for little feet
  Of children bleeding along the street:

  "For parked-up honours that gainsay
        The right of way:
  For almsgiving through a door that is
  Not open enough for two friends to kiss:

  "For love of freedom which abates
        Beyond the Straits:
  For patriot virtue starved to vice on
  Self-praise, self-interest, and suspicion:

  "For an oligarchic parliament,
        And bribes well-meant.
  What curse to another land assign,
  When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?"

  "Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
        My curse to-night.
  Because thou hast strength to see and hate
  A foul thing done within thy gate."

  "Not so," I answered once again.
        "To curse, choose men.
  For I, a woman, have only known
  How the heart melts and the tears run down."

  "Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
        My curse to-night.
  Some women weep and curse, I say
  (And no one marvels), night and day.

  "And thou shalt take their part to-night,
        Weep and write.
  A curse from the depths of womanhood
  Is very salt, and bitter, and good."

  So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed,
        What all may read.
  And thus, as was enjoined on me,
  I send it over the Western Sea.




THE CURSE.


  I.

  Because ye have broken your own chain
        With the strain
  Of brave men climbing a Nation's height,
  Yet thence bear down with brand and thong
  On souls of others,--for this wrong
        This is the curse. Write.

  Because yourselves are standing straight
        In the state
  Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,
  Yet keep calm footing all the time
  On writhing bond-slaves,--for this crime
        This is the curse. Write.

  Because ye prosper in God's name,
        With a claim
  To honour in the old world's sight,
  Yet do the fiend's work perfectly
  In strangling martyrs,--for this lie
        This is the curse. Write.

  II.

  Ye shall watch while kings conspire
  Round the people's smouldering fire,
    And, warm for your part,
  Shall never dare--O shame!
  To utter the thought into flame
    Which burns at your heart.
      This is the curse. Write.

  Ye shall watch while nations strive
  With the bloodhounds, die or survive,
    Drop faint from their jaws,
  Or throttle them backward to death;
  And only under your breath
    Shall favour the cause.
      This is the curse. Write.

  Ye shall watch while strong men draw
  The nets of feudal law
    To strangle the weak;
  And, counting the sin for a sin,
  Your soul shall be sadder within
    Than the word ye shall speak.
      This is the curse. Write.

  When good men are praying erect
  That Christ may avenge his elect
    And deliver the earth,
  The prayer in your ears, said low,
  Shall sound like the tramp of a foe
    That's driving you forth.
        This is the curse. Write.

  When wise men give you their praise,
  They shall pause in the heat of the phrase,
    As if carried too far.
  When ye boast your own charters kept true
  Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do
    Derides what ye are.
        This is the curse. Write.

  When fools cast taunts at your gate,
  Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate
    As ye look o'er the wall;
  For your conscience, tradition, and name
  Explode with a deadlier blame
    Than the worst of them all.
        This is the curse. Write.

  Go, wherever ill deeds shall be done,
  Go, plant your flag in the sun
    Beside the ill-doers!
  And recoil from clenching the curse
  Of God's witnessing Universe
    With a curse of yours.
        THIS is the curse. Write.


LITTLE MATTIE.


  I.

  Dead! Thirteen a month ago!
  Short and narrow her life's walk;
  Lover's love she could not know
  Even by a dream or talk:
  Too young to be glad of youth,
  Missing honour, labour, rest,
  And the warmth of a babe's mouth
  At the blossom of her breast.
  Must you pity her for this
  And for all the loss it is,
  You, her mother, with wet face,
  Having had all in your case?

  II.

  Just so young but yesternight,
  Now she is as old as death.
  Meek, obedient in your sight,
    Gentle to a beck or breath
  Only on last Monday! Yours,
    Answering you like silver bells
  Lightly touched! An hour matures:
    You can teach her nothing else.
  She has seen the mystery hid
  Under Egypt's pyramid:
  By those eyelids pale and close
  Now she knows what Rhamses knows.

  III.

  Cross her quiet hands, and smooth
    Down her patient locks of silk,
  Cold and passive as in truth
    You your fingers in spilt milk
  Drew along a marble floor;
    But her lips you cannot wring
  Into saying a word more,
    "Yes," or "No," or such a thing:
  Though you call and beg and wreak
  Half your soul out in a shriek,
  She will lie there in default
  And most innocent revolt.

  IV.

  Ay, and if she spoke, maybe
    She would answer, like the Son,
  "What is now 'twixt thee and me?"
    Dreadful answer! better none.
  Yours on Monday, God's to-day!
    Yours, your child, your blood, your heart,
  Called ... you called her, did you say,
    "Little Mattie" for your part?
  Now already it sounds strange,
  And you wonder, in this change,
  What He calls His angel-creature,
  Higher up than you can reach her.

  V.

  'T was a green and easy world
    As she took it; room to play
  (Though one's hair might get uncurled
    At the far end of the day).
  What she suffered she shook off
    In the sunshine; what she sinned
  She could pray on high, enough
    To keep safe above the wind.
  If reproved by God or you,
  'T was to better her, she knew;
  And if crossed, she gathered still
  'T was to cross out something ill.

  VI.

  You, you had the right, you thought,
    To survey her with sweet scorn,
  Poor gay child, who had not caught
    Yet the octave-stretch forlorn
  Of your larger wisdom! Nay,
    Now your places are changed so,
  In that same superior way
    She regards you dull and low
  As you did herself exempt
  From life's sorrows. Grand contempt
  Of the spirits risen awhile,
  Who look back with such a smile!

  VII.

  There's the sting of't. That, I think,
    Hurts the most a thousandfold!
  To feel sudden, at a wink,
    Some dear child we used to scold,
  Praise, love both ways, kiss and tease,
    Teach and tumble as our own,
  All its curls about our knees,
    Rise up suddenly full-grown.
  Who could wonder such a sight
  Made a woman mad outright?
  Show me Michael with the sword
  Rather than such angels, Lord!




A FALSE STEP.


  I.

  Sweet, thou hast trod on a heart.
    Pass; there's a world full of men;
  And women as fair as thou art
    Must do such things now and then.

  II.

  Thou only hast stepped unaware,--
    Malice, not one can impute;
  And why should a heart have been there
    In the way of a fair woman's foot?

  III.

  It was not a stone that could trip,
    Nor was it a thorn that could rend:
  Put up thy proud under-lip!
    'T was merely the heart of a friend.

  IV.

  And yet peradventure one day
    Thou, sitting alone at the glass,
  Remarking the bloom gone away,
    Where the smile in its dimplement was,

  V.

  And seeking around thee in vain
    From hundreds who flattered before,
  Such a word as "Oh, not in the main
    Do I hold thee less precious, but more!"...

  VI.

  Thou'lt sigh, very like, on thy part,
    "Of all I have known or can know,
  I wish I had only that Heart
    I trod upon ages ago!"




VOID IN LAW.


  I.

  Sleep, little babe, on my knee,
    Sleep, for the midnight is chill,
  And the moon has died out in the tree,
    And the great human world goeth ill.
  Sleep, for the wicked agree:
    Sleep, let them do as they will.
          Sleep.

  II.

  Sleep, thou hast drawn from my breast
    The last drop of milk that was good;
  And now, in a dream, suck the rest,
    Lest the real should trouble thy blood.
  Suck, little lips dispossessed,
    As we kiss in the air whom we would.
          Sleep.

  III.

  O lips of thy father! the same,
    So like! Very deeply they swore
  When he gave me his ring and his name,
    To take back, I imagined, no more!
  And now is all changed like a game,
    Though the old cards are used as of yore?
          Sleep.

  IV.

  "Void in law," said the Courts. Something wrong
    In the forms? Yet, "Till death part us two,
  I, James, take thee, Jessie," was strong,
    And ONE witness competent. True
  Such a marriage was worth an old song,
    Heard in Heaven though, as plain as the New.
          Sleep.

  V.

  Sleep, little child, his and mine!
    Her throat has the antelope curve,
  And her cheek just the colour and line
    Which fade not before him nor swerve:
  Yet she has no child!--the divine
    Seal of right upon loves that deserve.
          Sleep.

  VI.

  My child! though the world take her part,
    Saying "She was the woman to choose;
  He had eyes, was a man in his heart,"--
    We twain the decision refuse:
  We ... weak as I am, as thou art, ...
    Cling on to him, never to loose.
          Sleep.

  VII.

  He thinks that, when done with this place,
    All's ended? he'll new-stamp the ore?
  Yes, Cæsar's--but not in our case.
    Let him learn we are waiting before
  The grave's mouth, the heaven's gate, God's face
    With implacable love evermore.
          Sleep.

  VIII.

  He's ours, though he kissed her but now,
    He's ours, though she kissed in reply:
  He's ours, though himself disavow,
    And God's universe favour the lie;
  Ours to claim, ours to clasp, ours below,
    Ours above, ... if we live, if we die.
          Sleep.

  IX.

  Ah baby, my baby, too rough
    Is my lullaby? What have I said?
  Sleep! When I've wept long enough
    I shall learn to weep softly instead,
  And piece with some alien stuff
    My heart to lie smooth for thy head.
          Sleep.

  X.

  Two souls met upon thee, my sweet;
    Two loves led thee out to the sun:
  Alas, pretty hands, pretty feet,
    If the one who remains (only one)
  Set her grief at thee, turned in a heat
    To thine enemy,--were it well done?
          Sleep.

  XI.

  May He of the manger stand near
    And love thee! An infant He came
  To His own who rejected Him here,
    But the Magi brought gifts all the same.
  I hurry the cross on my Dear!
    My gifts are the griefs I declaim!
          Sleep.




LORD WALTER'S WIFE.


  I.

  "But why do you go?" said the lady, while both sat under the yew,
  And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the
        sea-blue.

  II.

  "Because I fear you," he answered;--"because you are far too fair,
  And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your gold-coloured hair."

  III.

  "Oh, that," she said, "is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone,
  And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun."

  IV.

  "Yet farewell so," he answered;--"the sun-stroke's fatal at times.
  I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the
        limes."

  V.

  "Oh, that," she said, "is no reason. You smell a rose through a
        fence:
  If two should smell it, what matter? who grumbles, and where's the
        pretence?"

  VI.

  "But I," he replied, "have promised another, when love was free,
  To love her alone, alone, who alone and afar loves me."

  VII.

  "Why, that," she said, "is no reason. Love's always free, I am
        told.
  Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it
        will hold?"

  VIII.

  "But you," he replied, "have a daughter, a young little child, who
        was laid
  In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me
        afraid."

  IX.

  "Oh, that," she said, "is no reason. The angels keep out of the
        way;
  And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me
        and stay."

  X.

  At which he rose up in his anger,--"Why, now, you no longer are
        fair!
  Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear."

  XI.

  At which she laughed out in her scorn: "These men! Oh, these men
        overnice,
  Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a
        vice."

  XII.

  Her eyes blazed upon him--"And you! You bring us your vices so
        near
  That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 't would
        defame us to hear!

  XIII.

  "What reason had you, and what right,--I appeal to your soul from my
        life,--
  To find me too fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife.

  XIV.

  "Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you
        imply
  I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me
        as high?

  XV.

  "If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much
  To uses unlawful and fatal. The praise!--shall I thank you for
        such?

  XVI.

  "Too fair?--not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a
        while,
  You attain to it, straightway you call us no longer too fair, but
        too vile.

  XVII.

  "A moment,--I pray your attention!--I have a poor word in my head
  I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better
        unsaid.

  XVIII.

  "You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a
        ring.
  You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter!--I've broken the
        thing.

  XIX.

  "You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and
        then
  In the senses--a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and
        some men.

  XX.

  "Love's a virtue for heroes!--as white as the snow on high hills,
  And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and
        fulfils.

  XXI.

  "I love my Walter profoundly,--you, Maude, though you faltered a
        week,
  For the sake of ... what was it--an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole
        on a cheek?

  XXII.

  "And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the
        frivolous cant
  About crimes irresistible, virtues that swindle, betray and
        supplant,

  XXIII.

  "I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or
        avow
  By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now.

  XXIV.

  "There! Look me full in the face!--in the face. Understand, if you
        can,
  That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man.

  XXV.

  "Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you
        a scar--
  You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are.

  XXVI.

  "You wronged me: but then I considered ... there's Walter! And so at
        the end
  I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a
        friend.

  XXVII.

  "Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my
        Walter, be mine!
  Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine."




BIANCA AMONG THE NIGHTINGALES.


  I.

  The cypress stood up like a church
    That night we felt our love would hold,
  And saintly moonlight seemed to search
    And wash the whole world clean as gold;
  The olives crystallized the vales'
    Broad slopes until the hills grew strong:
  The fire-flies and the nightingales
    Throbbed each to either, flame and song.
  The nightingales, the nightingales!

  II.

  Upon the angle of its shade
    The cypress stood, self-balanced high;
  Half up, half down, as double-made,
    Along the ground, against the sky;
  And we, too! from such soul-height went
    Such leaps of blood, so blindly driven,
  We scarce knew if our nature meant
    Most passionate earth or intense heaven
  The nightingales, the nightingales!

  III.

  We paled with love, we shook with love,
    We kissed so close we could not vow;
  Till Giulio whispered "Sweet, above
    God's Ever guaranties this Now."
  And through his words the nightingales
    Drove straight and full their long clear call,
  Like arrows through heroic mails,
    And love was awful in it all.
  The nightingales, the nightingales!

  IV.

  O cold white moonlight of the north,
    Refresh these pulses, quench this hell!
  O coverture of death drawn forth
    Across this garden-chamber ... well!
  But what have nightingales to do
    In gloomy England, called the free ...
  (Yes, free to die in!...) when we two
    Are sundered, singing still to me?
  And still they sing, the nightingales!

  V.

  I think I hear him, how he cried
    "My own soul's life!" between their notes.
  Each man has but one soul supplied,
    And that's immortal. Though his throat's
  On fire with passion now, to her
    He can't say what to me he said!
  And yet he moves her, they aver.
    The nightingales sing through my head,--
  The nightingales, the nightingales!

  VI.

  He says to her what moves her most.
    He would not name his soul within
  Her hearing,--rather pays her cost
    With praises to her lips and chin.
  Man has but one soul, 't is ordained,
    And each soul but one love, I add;
  Yet souls are damned and love's profaned;
    These nightingales will sing me mad!
  The nightingales, the nightingales!

  VII.

  I marvel how the birds can sing.
    There's little difference, in their view,
  Betwixt our Tuscan trees that spring
    As vital flames into the blue,
  And dull round blots of foliage meant,
    Like saturated sponges here,
  To suck the fogs up. As content
    Is he too in this land, 't is clear.
  And still they sing, the nightingales.

  VIII.

  My native Florence! dear, forgone!
    I see across the Alpine ridge
  How the last feast-day of Saint John
    Shot rockets from Carraia bridge.
  The luminous city, tall with fire,
    Trod deep down in that river of ours,
  While many a boat with lamp and choir
    Skimmed birdlike over glittering towers.
  I will not hear these nightingales.

  IX.

  I seem to float, we seem to float
    Down Arno's stream in festive guise;
  A boat strikes flame into our boat,
    And up that lady seems to rise
  As then she rose. The shock had flashed
    A vision on us! What a head,
  What leaping eyeballs!--beauty dashed
    To splendour by a sudden dread.
  And still they sing, the nightingales.

  X.

  Too bold to sin, too weak to die;
    Such women are so. As for me,
  I would we had drowned there, he and I,
    That moment, loving perfectly.
  He had not caught her with her loosed
    Gold ringlets ... rarer in the south ...
  Nor heard the "Grazie tanto" bruised
    To sweetness by her English mouth.
  And still they sing, the nightingales.

  XI.

  She had not reached him at my heart
    With her fine tongue, as snakes indeed
  Kill flies; nor had I, for my part,
    Yearned after, in my desperate need,
  And followed him as he did her
    To coasts left bitter by the tide,
  Whose very nightingales, elsewhere
    Delighting, torture and deride!
  For still they sing, the nightingales.

  XII.

  A worthless woman; mere cold clay
    As all false things are: but so fair,
  She takes the breath of men away
    Who gaze upon her unaware.
  I would not play her larcenous tricks
    To have her looks! She lied and stole,
  And spat into my love's pure pyx
    The rank saliva of her soul.
  And still they sing, the nightingales.

  XIII.

  I would not for her white and pink,
    Though such he likes--her grace of limb,
  Though such he has praised--nor yet, I think.
    For life itself, though spent with him,
  Commit such sacrilege, affront
    God's nature which is love, intrude
  'Twixt two affianced souls, and hunt
    Like spiders, in the altar's wood.
  I cannot bear these nightingales.

  XIV.

  If she chose sin, some gentler guise
    She might have sinned in, so it seems:
  She might have pricked out both my eyes,
    And I still seen him in my dreams!
  --Or drugged me in my soup or wine,
    Nor left me angry afterward:
  To die here with his hand in mine,
    His breath upon me, were not hard.
  (Our Lady hush these nightingales!)

  XV.

  But set a springe for him, "mio ben,"
    My only good, my first last love!--
  Though Christ knows well what sin is, when
    He sees some things done they must move
  Himself to wonder. Let her pass.
    I think of her by night and day.
  Must I too join her ... out, alas!...
    With Giulio, in each word I say?
  And evermore the nightingales!

  XVI.

  Giulio, my Giulio!--sing they so,
    And you be silent? Do I speak,
  And you not hear? An arm you throw
    Round someone, and I feel so weak?
  --Oh, owl-like birds! They sing for spite,
    They sing for hate, they sing for doom,
  They'll sing through death who sing through night,
    They'll sing and stun me in the tomb--
  The nightingales, the nightingales!




MY KATE.


  I.

  She was not as pretty as women I know,
  And yet all your best made of sunshine and snow
  Drop to shade, melt to nought in the long-trodden ways,
  While she's still remembered on warm and cold days--
                                          My Kate.

  II.

  Her air had a meaning, her movements a grace;
  You turned from the fairest to gaze on her face:
  And when you had once seen her forehead and mouth,
  You saw as distinctly her soul and her truth--
                                          My Kate.

  III.

  Such a blue inner light from her eyelids outbroke,
  You looked at her silence and fancied she spoke:
  When she did, so peculiar yet soft was the tone,
  Though the loudest spoke also, you heard her alone--
                                          My Kate.

  IV.

  I doubt if she said to you much that could act
  As a thought or suggestion: she did not attract
  In the sense of the brilliant or wise: I infer
  'T was her thinking of others made you think of her--
                                          My Kate.

  V.

  She never found fault with you, never implied
  Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side
  Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town
  The children were gladder that pulled at her gown--
                                          My Kate.

  VI.

  None knelt at her feet confessed lovers in thrall;
  They knelt more to God than they used,--that was all:
  If you praised her as charming, some asked what you meant,
  But the charm of her presence was felt when she went--
                                          My Kate.

  VII.

  The weak and the gentle, the ribald and rude,
  She took as she found them, and did them all good;
  It always was so with her--see what you have!
  She has made the grass greener even here ... with her grave--
                                          My Kate.

  VIII.

  My dear one!--when thou wast alive with the rest,
  I held thee the sweetest and loved thee the best:
  And now thou art dead, shall I not take thy part
  As thy smiles used to do for thyself, my sweet Heart--
                                          My Kate?




A SONG FOR THE RAGGED SCHOOL OF LONDON.

WRITTEN IN ROME.


  I.

  I am listening here in Rome.
    "England's strong," say many speakers,
  "If she winks, the Czar must come,
    Prow and topsail, to the breakers."

  II.

  "England's rich in coal and oak,"
    Adds a Roman, getting moody;
  "If she shakes a travelling cloak,
    Down our Appian roll the scudi."

  III.

  "England's righteous," they rejoin:
    "Who shall grudge her exaltations
  When her wealth of golden coin
    Works the welfare of the nations?"

  IV.

  I am listening here in Rome.
    Over Alps a voice is sweeping--
  "England's cruel, save us some
    Of these victims in her keeping!"

  V.

  As the cry beneath the wheel
    Of an old triumphant Roman
  Cleft the people's shouts like steel,
    While the show was spoilt for no man,

  VI.

  Comes that voice. Let others shout,
    Other poets praise my land here:
  I am sadly sitting out,
    Praying, "God forgive her grandeur."

  VII.

  Shall we boast of empire, where
    Time with ruin sits commissioned?
  In God's liberal blue air
    Peter's dome itself looks wizened;

  VIII.

  And the mountains, in disdain,
    Gather back their lights of opal
  From the dumb despondent plain
    Heaped with jawbones of a people.

  IX.

  Lordly English, think it o'er,
    Cæsar's doing is all undone!
  You have cannons on your shore,
    And free Parliaments in London;

  X.

  Princes' parks, and merchants' homes,
    Tents for soldiers, ships for seamen,--
  Ay, but ruins worse than Rome's
    In your pauper men and women.

  XI.

  Women leering through the gas
    (Just such bosoms used to nurse you),
  Men, turned wolves by famine--pass!
    Those can speak themselves, and curse you.

  XII.

  But these others--children small,
    Spilt like blots about the city,
  Quay, and street, and palace-wall--
    Take them up into your pity!

  XIII.

  Ragged children with bare feet,
    Whom the angels in white raiment
  Know the names of, to repeat
    When they come on you for payment.

  XIV.

  Ragged children, hungry-eyed,
    Huddled up out of the coldness
  On your doorsteps, side by side,
    Till your footman damns their boldness.

  XV.

  In the alleys, in the squares,
    Begging, lying little rebels;
  In the noisy thoroughfares,
    Struggling on with piteous trebles.

  XVI.

  Patient children--think what pain
    Makes a young child patient--ponder!
  Wronged too commonly to strain
    After right, or wish, or wonder.

  XVII.

  Wicked children, with peaked chins,
    And old foreheads! there are many
  With no pleasures except sins,
    Gambling with a stolen penny.

  XVIII.

  Sickly children, that whine low
    To themselves and not their mothers,
  From mere habit,--never so
    Hoping help or care from others.

  XIX.

  Healthy children, with those blue
    English eyes, fresh from their Maker,
  Fierce and ravenous, staring through
    At the brown loaves of the baker.

  XX.

  I am listening here in Rome,
    And the Romans are confessing,
  "English children pass in bloom
    All the prettiest made for blessing.

  XXI.

  "Angli angeli!" (resumed
    From the mediæval story)
  "Such rose angelhoods, emplumed
    In such ringlets of pure glory!"

  XXII.

  Can we smooth down the bright hair,
    O my sisters, calm, unthrilled in
  Our heart's pulses? Can we bear
    The sweet looks of our own children,

  XXIII.

  While those others, lean and small,
    Scurf and mildew of the city,
  Spot our streets, convict us all
    Till we take them into pity?

  XXIV.

  "Is it our fault?" you reply,
    "When, throughout civilization,
  Every nation's empery
    Is asserted by starvation?

  XXV.

  "All these mouths we cannot feed,
    And we cannot clothe these bodies."
  Well, if man's so hard indeed,
    Let them learn at least what God is!

  XXVI.

  Little outcasts from life's fold,
    The grave's hope they may be joined in
  By Christ's covenant consoled
    For our social contract's grinding.

  XXVII.

  If no better can be done,
    Let us do but this,--endeavour
  That the sun behind the sun
    Shine upon them while they shiver!

  XXVIII.

  On the dismal London flags,
    Through the cruel social juggle,
  Put a thought beneath their rags
    To ennoble the heart's struggle.

  XXIX.

  O my sisters, not so much
    Are we asked for--not a blossom
  From our children's nosegay, such
  As we gave it from our bosom,--

  XXX.

  Not the milk left in their cup,
    Not the lamp while they are sleeping,
  Not the little cloak hung up
    While the coat's in daily keeping,--

  XXXI.

  But a place in RAGGED SCHOOLS,
    Where the outcasts may to-morrow
  Learn by gentle words and rules
    Just the uses of their sorrow.

  XXXII.

  O my sisters! children small,
    Blue-eyed, wailing through the city--
  Our own babes cry in them all:
    Let us take them into pity.




MAY'S LOVE.

[Illustration: Handwritten Copy of Poem]


  I.

  You love all, you say,
    Round, beneath, above me:
  Find me then some way
    Better than to love me,
  Me, too, dearest May!

  II.

  O world-kissing eyes
    Which the blue heavens melt to;
  I, sad, overwise,
    Loathe the sweet looks dealt to
  All things--men and flies.

  III.

  You love all, you say:
    Therefore, Dear, abate me
  Just your love, I pray!
    Shut your eyes and hate me--
  Only me--fair May!




AMY'S CRUELTY.


  I.

  Fair Amy of the terraced house,
    Assist me to discover
  Why you who would not hurt a mouse
    Can torture so your lover.

  II.

  You give your coffee to the cat,
    You stroke the dog for coming,
  And all your face grows kinder at
    The little brown bee's humming.

  III.

  But when he haunts your door ... the town
    Marks coming and marks going ...
  You seem to have stitched your eyelids down
    To that long piece of sewing!

  IV.

  You never give a look, not you,
    Nor drop him a "Good morning,"
  To keep his long day warm and blue,
    So fretted by your scorning.

  V.

  She shook her head--"The mouse and bee
    For crumb or flower will linger:
  The dog is happy at my knee,
    The cat purrs at my finger.

  VI.

  "But he ... to him, the least thing given
    Means great things at a distance;
  He wants my world, my sun, my heaven,
    Soul, body, whole existence.

  VII.

  "They say love gives as well as takes;
    But I'm a simple maiden,--
  My mother's first smile when she wakes
    I still have smiled and prayed in.

  VIII.

  "I only know my mother's love
    Which gives all and asks nothing;
  And this new loving sets the groove
    Too much the way of loathing.

  IX.

  "Unless he gives me all in change,
    I forfeit all things by him:
  The risk is terrible and strange--
    I tremble, doubt, ... deny him.

  X.

  "He's sweetest friend or hardest foe,
    Best angel or worst devil;
  I either hate or ... love him so,
    I can't be merely civil!

  XI.

  "You trust a woman who puts forth
    Her blossoms thick as summer's?
  You think she dreams what love is worth,
    Who casts it to new-comers?

  XII.

  "Such love's a cowslip-ball to fling,
    A moment's pretty pastime;
  I give ... all me, if anything,
    The first time and the last time.

  XIII.

  "Dear neighbour of the trellised house,
    A man should murmur never,
  Though treated worse than dog and mouse,
    Till doated on for ever!"




MY HEART AND I.


  I.

  Enough! we're tired, my heart and I.
    We sit beside the headstone thus,
    And wish that name were carved for us.
  The moss reprints more tenderly
    The hard types of the mason's knife,
    As heaven's sweet life renews earth's life
  With which we're tired, my heart and I.

  II.

  You see we're tired, my heart and I.
    We dealt with books, we trusted men,
    And in our own blood drenched the pen,
  As if such colours could not fly.
    We walked too straight for fortune's end,
    We loved too true to keep a friend;
  At last we're tired, my heart and I.

  III.

  How tired we feel, my heart and I!
    We seem of no use in the world;
    Our fancies hang grey and uncurled
  About men's eyes indifferently;
    Our voice which thrilled you so, will let
    You sleep; our tears are only wet:
  What do we here, my heart and I?

  IV.

  So tired, so tired, my heart and I!
    It was not thus in that old time
    When Ralph sat with me 'neath the lime
  To watch the sunset from the sky.
    "Dear love, you're looking tired," he said;
    I, smiling at him, shook my head:
  'T is now we're tired, my heart and I.

  V.

  So tired, so tired, my heart and I!
    Though now none takes me on his arm
    To fold me close and kiss me warm
  Till each quick breath end in a sigh
    Of happy languor. Now, alone,
    We lean upon this graveyard stone,
  Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I.

  VI.

  Tired out we are, my heart and I.
    Suppose the world brought diadems
    To tempt us, crusted with loose gems
  Of powers and pleasures? Let it try.
    We scarcely care to look at even
    A pretty child, or God's blue heaven,
  We feel so tired, my heart and I.

  VII.

  Yet who complains? My heart and I?
    In this abundant earth no doubt
    Is little room for things worn out:
  Disdain them, break them, throw them by!
    And if before the days grew rough
    We once were loved, used,--well enough,
  I think, we've fared, my heart and I.




THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD.


  What's the best thing in the world?
  June-rose, by May-dew impearled;
  Sweet south-wind, that means no rain;
  Truth, not cruel to a friend;
  Pleasure, not in haste to end;
  Beauty, not self-decked and curled
  Till its pride is over-plain;
  Light, that never makes you wink;
  Memory, that gives no pain;
  Love, when, so, you're loved again.
  What's the best thing in the world?
  --Something out of it, I think.




WHERE'S AGNES?


  I.

  Nay, if I had come back so,
    And found her dead in her grave,
  And if a friend I know
    Had said, "Be strong, nor rave:
  She lies there, dead below:

  II.

  "I saw her, I who speak,
    White, stiff, the face one blank:
  The blue shade came to her cheek
    Before they nailed the plank,
  For she had been dead a week."

  III.

  Why, if he had spoken so,
    I might have believed the thing,
  Although her look, although
    Her step, laugh, voice's ring
  Lived in me still as they do.

  IV.

  But dead that other way,
    Corrupted thus and lost?
  That sort of worm in the clay?
    I cannot count the cost,
  That I should rise and pay.

  V.

  My Agnes false? such shame?
    She? Rather be it said
  That the pure saint of her name
    Has stood there in her stead,
  And tricked you to this blame.

  VI.

  Her very gown, her cloak
    Fell chastely: no disguise,
  But expression! while she broke
    With her clear grey morning-eyes
  Full upon me and then spoke.

  VII.

  She wore her hair away
    From her forehead,--like a cloud
  Which a little wind in May
    Peels off finely: disallowed
  Though bright enough to stay.

  VIII.

  For the heavens must have the place
    To themselves, to use and shine in,
  As her soul would have her face
    To press through upon mine, in
  That orb of angel grace.

  IX.

  Had she any fault at all,
    'T was having none, I thought too--
  There seemed a sort of thrall;
    As she felt her shadow ought to
  Fall straight upon the wall.

  X.

  Her sweetness strained the sense
    Of common life and duty;
  And every day's expense
    Of moving in such beauty
  Required, almost, defence.

  XI.

  What good, I thought, is done
    By such sweet things, if any?
  This world smells ill i' the sun
    Though the garden-flowers are many,--
  She is only one.

  XII.

  Can a voice so low and soft
    Take open actual part
  With Right,--maintain aloft
    Pure truth in life or art,
  Vexed always, wounded oft?--

  XIII.

  She fit, with that fair pose
    Which melts from curve to curve,
  To stand, run, work with those
    Who wrestle and deserve,
  And speak plain without glose?

  XIV.

  But I turned round on my fear
    Defiant, disagreeing--
  What if God has set her here
    Less for action than for Being?--
  For the eye and for the ear.

  XV.

  Just to show what beauty may,
    Just to prove what music can,--
  And then to die away
    From the presence of a man,
  Who shall learn, henceforth, to pray?

  XVI.

  As a door, left half ajar
    In heaven, would make him think
  How heavenly-different are
    Things glanced at through the chink,
  Till he pined from near to far.

  XVII.

  That door could lead to hell?
    That shining merely meant
  Damnation? What! She fell
    Like a woman, who was sent
  Like an angel, by a spell?

  XVIII.

  She, who scarcely trod the earth,
    Turned mere dirt? My Agnes,--mine!
  Called so! felt of too much worth
    To be used so! too divine
  To be breathed near, and so forth!

  XIX.

  Why, I dared not name a sin
    In her presence: I went round,
  Clipped its name and shut it in
    Some mysterious crystal sound,--
  Changed the dagger for the pin.

  XX.

  Now you name herself that word?
    O my Agnes! O my saint!
  Then the great joys of the Lord
    Do not last? Then all this paint
  Runs off nature? leaves a board?

  XXI.

  Who's dead here? No, not she:
    Rather I! or whence this damp
  Cold corruption's misery?
    While my very mourners stamp
  Closer in the clods on me.

  XXII.

  And my mouth is full of dust
    Till I cannot speak and curse--
  Speak and damn him ... "Blame's unjust"?
    Sin blots out the universe,
  All because she would and must?

  XXIII.

  She, my white rose, dropping off
    The high rose-tree branch! and not
  That the night-wind blew too rough,
    Or the noon-sun burnt too hot,
  But, that being a rose--'t was enough!

  XXIV.

  Then henceforth may earth grow trees!
    No more roses!--hard straight lines
  To score lies out! none of these
    Fluctuant curves, but firs and pines,
  Poplars, cedars, cypresses!
